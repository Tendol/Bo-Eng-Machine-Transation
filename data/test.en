at a time when the king of anga and his armies were dominant
he called up the four branches of his armed forces

at other times king mahapadma and his armies were dominant
at times the king of anga and his armies were dominant
while the bodhisattva was dwelling in the abode of tusita
meanwhile king mahapadma ruled over the lands of magadha under his rule the kingdom prospered and thrived crops were bountiful
querying upasena and a summary

is told in sections on
he too called up the four branches of his armed forces
the elephant corps the cavalry the charioteer corps and the infantryand laid waste to all of anga save campa before returning
at yet another time when the king of anga and his armies were dominant
then he said to his ministers
head in hands he sat and sat absorbed in thought
king mahapadma was unsettled by the message he heard
flee to the mountaintops and even there you shall find no escape
tunnel beneath the earth and i will yank you up as if with a hook
if you do not surrender and instead take flight into the sky above i will fell you with a volley of arrows
it would be good were you to come out
the king of anga sent an envoy to king mahapadma with the message
entering rajagrha he closed the gates and shut himself up within the walls of his fortress
defeated and frightened destroyed and conquered king mahapadma retreated
the king of anga captured king mahapadmas entire elephant corps
and proceeded to capture the whole of his cavalry charioteer corps and infantry
and rode out to meet the king of anga in battle
when king mahapadma heard this he too called up the four branches of his armed forcesthe elephant corps the cavalry the charioteer corps and the infantry
they spoke in verse
when land and life are threatened
seek always to protect life
when the wise look at both
king mahapadma hung his sword from his neck in surrender and went out
where the king of anga imposed an annual tribute and tax upon him
while the blessed bodhisattva was dwelling in the abode of tusita
he saw five sights and thrice gave notice to the six classes of gods who revel in the desire realm
assuming an elephants appearance
he entered his mothers womb as the earth shook and this world
and all others too were bathed in a vast light more luminous than the glow of the gods of the thirtythree
in rajagrha the son of king mahapadma was born
in sravasti the son of king arada brahmadatta was born
at the same time as the blessed bodhisattva was born
sons were also born to four great kings in four great citystates
there are others who have been born here
so great was this miraculous manifestation it was as if the sun and moon shone in the gulf between worlds so great was its strength that darkness everywhere
even the pitchblack darkness of dark places dark from never knowing the light of the sun and moon was filled with a vast light
beings born in those places had never even seen so far as their outstretched hands yet by this light these beings saw one another and exclaimed you there there are others who have been born here
and his military might is great
ruthless
gentlemen this king of anga is belligerent
in ujjayini the son of king anantanemi was born
in kausambi the son of king satanika was born
when the blessed bodhisattva was born
the entire universe was bathed in a vast light more luminous than the glow of the gods of the thirtythree
so great was this miraculous manifestation it was as if the sun and moon shone in the gulf between worlds
beings born in those places had never even seen so far as their outstretched hands
yet by this light these beings saw one another and exclaimed you there there are others who have been born here
there are others who have been born here
king mahapadma thought
when my son was born the world was lit as if by the gold of the rising sun
and as he is the son of queen bimbi goldie
i shall name this prince bimbisara essence of gold
and so the boy was named bimbisara
king arada brahmadatta thought
when my son was born the world was lit as if by the light of lights
so i shall name this prince prasenajit supreme light
and so the boy was named prasenajit
king satanika thought
when my son was born the world was lit as if by the rising sun so i shall name this prince udayana rising
and so the boy was named udayana
king anantanemi thought
when my son was born the world was lit by a brilliant light so i shall name this prince pradyota brilliant light
and so the boy was named pradyota
and so each king attributed the light to the birth of his own son
so great was its strength that darkness everywhere even the pitchblack darkness of dark places dark from never knowing the light of the sun and moon was filled with a vast light
though each attributed it to his own son
it was not so
for all that occurred occurred because of the bodhisattva
on the very same day that prince bimbisara was born
five hundred sons of five hundred ministers were also born
and were given names appropriate to their patrilineage
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
these arts and skills were also mastered by the five hundred sons of the five hundred ministers
bimbisaras father enrolled him in the eighteen guilds due to which he was named and became known as bimbisara of the guilds
later prince bimbisara ventured into the countryside astride an elephant
where he saw the king of angas officers collecting tributes and taxes prompting him to inquire of his men
gentlemen for whom are these tributes and taxes being collected
what will we be offered tribute
when the officers were summoned he said
if i too have been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king
why is it you are collecting tributes and taxes here
gentlemen the king of anga has been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king
i forbid you to collect tributes and taxes from this day forth
gentlemen the prince doesnt understand the situation continue to collect tributes and taxes as you have done before
they went to king mahapadma and said
your majesty when we officers of the king of anga were collecting tributes and taxes
prince bimbisara stopped us from doing so
shall we collect them or not
the prince fails to appreciate the situation they thought let us go submit the matter to king mahapadma
they had begun their collection again
when prince bimbisara spotted them on their way back from the countryside and said
gentlemen have i not already prohibited you from collecting tributes and taxes
why are you collecting them again
you are to desist fail to desist and i shall close the borders
frightened they thought
the prince is dangerous and ruthless
in time he may pose a serious risk to us
we must go warn the king of anga
they went before the king of anga and said
your majesty as officers of the court
we were collecting tributes and taxes on your behalf when king mahapadmas son prince bimbisara stopped us
if your majesty ignores the princes actions
he may in time pose a serious risk to us
then they spoke in verse
when a tree is small fingernails may fell it
yet when the tree is large
even a hundred axes may fail
son we are tributaries
they have sent me a letter expressing their anger
son why did you stop the king of angas officers from collecting tributes and taxes
then he summoned prince bimbisara and said
he sat and sat absorbed in thought
king mahapadma heard this letter read and was troubled head in hands
the king of anga sent a letter to king mahapadma send prince bimbisara with his sword hung from his neck
or prepare your pyre and shroud for i myself will come
and we too have been crowned and anointed ksatriya kings
why do we offer tribute and taxes to him
give me an army of just four divisions your majesty
and i will meet the king of anga in battle
king mahapadma then sent a message to the king of anga saying you had best hope all the power forces will and authority you possess do not fail you
the king of anga found this message intolerable and commanded his ministers
gentlemen lay waste to those lands
call up the four branches of the armed forces
if he falls then all fall
as spokes at a hubs collapse
in whose house dwells glory
it is he we should protect
then they said in verse
gentlemen what if i were to meet the king of anga in battle what would you do
prince your struggle shall be our struggle they responded
prince bimbisara gathered the five hundred ministers sons and said
he summoned prince bimbisara and gave him charge over the four branches of the armed forces
king mahapadma was troubled by this news and head in hands sat and sat absorbed in thought
now you must do all you can to protect me
whatever your majestys plight may be that too shall be ours
wherever your majestys foot may fall there shall we bow our heads
the four branches of the armed forces were then called up
and they set out from rajagrha
when king mahapadma who sat shut up in his upper citadel surrounded by his council saw them depart he asked his ministers
gentlemen whose army is this
your majesty it is prince bimbisaras
gentlemen it is awesome to behold
hence the prince was named and became known as bimbisara of the army
some knew him as bimbisara of the guilds while some knew him as bimbisara of the army
prince bimbisara said to the five hundred sons of the ministers
gentlemen this king of anga is belligerent ruthless and his military might is great so we cannot meet him in battle
therefore we will sneak in overrun his exposed camp and kill him while their guard is down and their armor off
they overran the king of angas exposed camp while their guard was down and their armor off sneaking up and killing him
the four branches of the king of angas armed forces scattered to the four directions
prince bimbisara sent mounted emissaries in the four directions with the message
gentlemen you have been crowned and anointed kings of ksatriya
and i too have been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king so return
i for my part will assume the reins of power here
and so prince bimbisara assumed the reins of power under him the kingdom prospered and thrived crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people
once king mahapadmas time had come
the ministers of rajagrha sent a message to king bimbisara saying your majesty your fathers time has come
in a great coronation ceremony the ministers of rajagrha and magadha granted him sovereignty over the lands of anga and magadha
under king bimbisaras rule the kingdoms of anga and magadha prospered and thrived crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people
seek always to protect life
when the wise look at both
they see land but not life can be found again
with that thought he hung his sword from his neck in surrender and came out
son you must take the reins of power there
your majesty tell me what else needs to be done and i shall see to it
pleased king mahapadma sent prince bimbisara a parasol a turban and a coronet with the message
your majesty i have slain the king of anga and campa is now in my hands
with the king of anga slain campa fell into prince bimbisaras hands at which point he sent a message to king mahapadma saying
when land and life are threatened
it distressed the steward of campa to hear this and he thought of this verse
it is i who has brought your lord to this state
come out immediately and i shall look favorably upon you
fail to appear and you too will soon find yourself in this state
when at last prince bimbisara reached campa
the prince fixed the king of angas head onto a long pole and displayed it saying
he rid the land of brigands thieves famine and illness and brought a wealth of rice sugar cane cattle and buffalo
devout the just king ruled justly
there was a young brahmin who desiring and in search of esoteric instruction left the middle country and went to the south
there in a land not his own lived a teacher of brahmins who had mastered the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
the young brahmin went to see this teacher of brahmins serene the young brahmin bowed his head calmly and sat off to one side
the brahmin teacher warmly greeted him with words of welcome and asked
young brahmin where have you come from and what do you desire
i hail from the middle country and i seek to serve at the feet of a master
why so that i may recite the vedas
excellent my son you should do just that
for that is a brahmins duty
and so the young brahmin began to recite the vedas with the teacher of brahmins
the brahmins students were in the habit
on the way they had the following conversation
to begin with let us share where we come from from which land we hail
one young brahmin responded
i am from the east
once when not occupied with their studies they went to collect wood for fire pujas
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
he completely pacified conflict aggressors and enemies from without as well as disturbances from within
said another
i am from the south
i am from the west
i am from the north
the young brahmin then said
i am from the middle country
to him they said
sir we have seen and heard of all those other countries
but have neither seen nor heard of the middle country
in the east they are wise
in the south they are cunning
in the west they stir division
in the north they speak roughly
and then they added this verse
young brahmin they asked what is the middle country like
gentlemen the middle country is the best of all lands
abounding in rice sugar cane cattle and buffalo
at one point where sages are known to gather the river flows through eighteen bends
there sages seek to bodily rise to the heavens through their practice of austerities
young brahmin having met you we have another question
do you have men counted as learned in the middle country
young brahmin you did say that
thronging with hundreds of honest women and filled with upstanding men devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
the river ganga bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shores
young brahmin are there any in the middle country like our master the wisest of philosophers
gentlemen in the middle country the philosophers are such that our teacher could not even look them in the face
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
on hearing the young brahmin speak so highly of the middle country
they were moved by the desire to visit it
the young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pujas
bearing their loads of wood they came to the house in which the teacher of brahmins lived
on arriving they set their loads of wood off to one side
went to him and said
master please listen
the young brahmin from the middle country speaks so highly of it that we are moved by the desire to visit
the brahmin said
boys would you visit every place of which you hear
my sons do i say i am the one and only philosopher on this earth
that there are no other philosophers
after all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after another
along the way he defeated an opponent in debate and then bound him to his chariot
he poured ashes from a pot on anothers head
another steered clear of him like a crow does an archery range
another received him with parasols victory banners and standards
the brahmin thought
why bother pulling off the branches petals and leaves while leaving the root
since all worthy opponents and anyone counted as learned will be close to the king
it is the king i shall see
with that the brahmin went to see king bimbisara
on arriving he wished king bimbisara success and long life
took a place off to one side and addressed him
your majesty from my guru i have received a few teachings
and so i seek to settle a matter in debate with an opponent in your majestys presence
the king asked his ministers
gentlemen are there any opponents in my kingdom capable of settling a matter in debate with this brahmin
he has put together a work known as matharas treatise
summon master mathara
as you wish your majesty
mathara received the summons and went to see king bimbisara
on arrival he wished king bimbisara success and long life then took a place off to one side
with blazing intelligence this capable man illuminates his own assertions and smashes those of others
your majesty in the village of nalada there is a brahmin known as mathara
who has mastered the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
having collected their things the brahmin set off with the young brahmins for the middle country
in that case my sons let us gather our funds robes walking staffs ladles funnels and washing bowls and go to the middle country
as the brahmin was attached to his students and his circle of students was small he said to the young brahmins
we will go to the middle country
we will make a name for ourselves and find our fortune too
we will defeat opponents
we will serve the wisest of philosophers
we will see that country yet master if only for a short while we will bathe on the banks of the river
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
master according to this young brahmin in the middle country the philosophers are such that you our teacher could not even look them in the face
since you seem to derive so much pleasure from hearing of other countries i would suggest you not visit those places you hear about
the ministers said
this is the master your majesty
the king greeted him with words of welcome and asked
master can you settle a matter in debate in my presence with this brahmin
replied mathara
i as a capable man shall do as the king pleases
the king ordered the ministers
gentlemen prepare the debate arena
and assign the disputants their roles
the ministers prepared the debate arena and assigned the disputants their roles
the ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and asked
your majesty who would you have defend a position first
this brahmin is a visitor so have him defend a position first
having been assigned to defend a position first the brahmin proceeded to recite five hundred stanzas
mathara repeated them and then said
this position of yours is devoid of logic
it is inconsistent and incoherent
the brahmin remained silent as mathara pointed out the positions faults
that the brahmin had no confidence to respond was damning and among the reasons he was vanquished
the king asked the ministers
gentlemen who won
mathara your majesty
this pleased the king who straightened up extended his right arm
it is a fine discovery for me to find this wisest of philosophers in my kingdom
master where do you live
your majesty in nalada
go and let that village be your victors prize
mathara was thrilled delighted and overjoyed
surrounded by learned men
he returned to his village
and since the world desires success and distrusts failure several brahmins pressed their daughters on him in marriage
mathara then took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all their desires
the wife with whom he sported made love and indulged all desires gave birth to a son with an extraordinarily long torso
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style
during which time they chose a name for the boy
the relatives said
since this boy has an extraordinarily long torso he should be named kosthila long torso
the young brahmin was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle him
two to breastfeed him
two to change his diapers
and two to play with him
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
when he was old enough he was introduced to letters
he was instructed in the ways of brahmins
number names calculation counting by hand how to exclude to add and to leave and to parse until he had mastered reading
their conduct ritual purity and observances the handling of ashes the handling of ritual vases and the handling of sites
hand gestures turbans offering praise and salutations
the rgveda the yajurveda the samaveda and the atharvaveda
and a brahmins six duties
making ritual sacrifices officiating over ritual sacrifices studying teaching giving and receiving
he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions
and vanquish those of others
her father taught her how to combine letters into words so she became proficient in reading
later when the young brahmin kosthila was debating sarika sarika vanquished him
and their father said to kosthila
son if you are a male how has a female vanquished you
once im gone the spoils ive won in debate will be taken away
at that the young brahmin kosthila desiring and in search of esoteric instruction set off from the middle country for the south
there in a country not his own lived a brahmin named tisya who was learned in lokayata philosophy
a teacher of brahmins and a master of the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
kosthila went to see the brahmin tisya
serene the young brahmin kosthila bowed at tisyas feet and sat off to one side
tisya warmly greeted kosthila with words of welcome asking
young brahmin where have you come from and what do you desire
i hail from the middle country
and i seek to serve at the feet of the master
why
so that i may uphold the lokayata philosophy
and so the young brahmin kosthila began to study lokayata philosophy in the presence of the brahmin tisya
the girl sarika was nurtured and grew
the relatives said
since this girl has eyes like a sari this girl should be given the name sarika
during which time they chose a name for the girl
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate her birth in grand style
the wife with whom mathara sported made love and indulged all desires again gave birth this time to a girl with eyes like a sari bird
the brahmins students were in the habit
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
visiting the city or collecting wood for use in fire pujas
once when not occupied with their studies they went to collect wood for fire pujas
i am from the east
one young brahmin responded
said another
i am from the south
i am from the west
i am from the north
the young brahmin then said
i am from the middle country
sir we have seen and heard of all those other countries but have neither seen nor heard of the middle country

the river ganga bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shores
at one point where sages are known to gather the river flows through eighteen bends
there sages seek to bodily rise to the heavens through their practice of austerities
young brahmin having met you we have another question
do you have men counted as learned in the middle country
gentlemen from the first did i not say gentlemen the middle country is filled with upstanding men
devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
young brahmin you did say that
young brahmin are there any in the middle country like our master the wisest of philosophers
on hearing the young brahmin speak so highly of the middle country
they were moved by the desire to visit it
the young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pujas

on arriving they set their loads of wood off to one side went to him and said

the brahmin tisya said
boys would you visit every place of which you hear
after all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after another
my sons do i say i am the one and only philosopher on this earth that there are no other philosophers
master according to this young brahmin in the middle country the philosophers are such that you our teacher could not even look them in the face
since you seem to derive so much pleasure from hearing of other countries i would suggest you not visit those places you hear about
gentlemen in the middle country the philosophers are such that our teacher could not even look them in the face so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
we will serve the wisest of philosophers
we will see that country yet master if only for a short while
we will bathe on the banks of the river
we will defeat opponents
we will make a name for ourselves and find our fortune too
we will go to the middle country
as the brahmin was attached to his students
and his circle of students was small he said to the young brahmins
in that case my sons let us gather our funds robes walking staffs ladles funnels and washing bowls and go to the middle country
having collected their things the brahmin set off with the young brahmins for the middle country
along the way he defeated an opponent in debate and then bound him to his chariot
he poured ashes from a pot on anothers head
another steered clear of him like a crow does an archery range
another received him with parasols victory banners and standards
another made a pledge to become his student
as he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached rajagrha
the brahmin tisya thought
why bother pulling off the branches petals and leaves while leaving the root
on arriving he wished the king success and long life
took a place off to one side and addressed him
your majesty from my guru i have received a few teachings
in time the brahmin tisya went to see king bimbisara
it is the king i shall see
since all worthy opponents and anyone counted as learned will be close to the king
and so i seek to settle a matter in debate with an opponent in your majestys presence
summon master mathara
the king asked the ministers gentlemen where is master mathara in nalada your majesty
as you wish your majesty on receiving the summons mathara went to see king bimbisara
on arrival he wished the king success and long life then took a place off to one side
the ministers said
this is the master your majesty
the king greeted him with words of welcome and asked
master can you settle a matter in debate in my presence with this brahmin tisya
replied mathara
i as a capable man shall do as the king pleases
the brahmin tisya repeated them and
this position of yours is devoid of logic
it is inconsistent and incoherent
the other brahmin remained silent as tisya pointed out the texts faults
i shall focus on an old text and with that he recited five hundred stanzas
this brahmin tisya is clearly acquainted with new treatises so i cannot debate him on them
the brahmin mathara thought
as the brahmin mathara is the elder i ask that you have him defend a position first
said he brahmin tisya
the brahmin tisya is a visitor so have him defend a position first
the ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and asked
the ministers prepared the debate arena and assigned the disputants their roles
the king ordered the ministers
gentlemen prepare the debate arena and assign the disputants their roles
that mathara had no confidence to respond was damning and among the reasons he was vanquished
the king asked the ministers
gentlemen who won
the brahmin tisya your majesty
gentlemen give the brahmin tisya a victors prize
therefore make the village of nalada the standard victors prize
take it from the brahmin mathara
and give it to this brahmin
and if any other should best tisya then award it to the victor
the village was then taken from the brahmin mathara and given to the brahmin tisya
the brahmin mathara thought
though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i shall go elsewhere he said to his wife
noble lady though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i shall go elsewhere so pack up our household
with that they began packing up their household
when their relatives heard that the master mathara was leaving
they went to see him and asked
master why are you packing up your household
gentlemen though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
therefore i shall go elsewhere
mathara replied in verse
better to live in anothers land than to be oppressed in ones own
there where a man lives free is the place he finds his home and friends
master do not leave for other parts remain for a while at your leisure in the home of your relatives
if you give a prize to everyone who wins a debate before long your lands of anga and magadha will themselves be victors prizes
they replied
gentlemen said the king that is what i shall do
when the brahmin tisya heard that the master mathara was to leave
he went to him and said
i have come only for a short time and before long am certain to go
let this remain your victors prize
do not leave you must stay
mathara replied i intend to leave young brahmin
mathara thought
though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i will give sarika to him as a wife mathara then said to his wife
noble lady though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
why would you give sarika to him in marriage
his parents said
anyone else in our position would try to take his life if he has robbed us so
hasnt he robbed us of our livelihood
father mother how could i accept this enemy into our family
i shall give sarika to him as a wife kosthila replied
son though we have done much for this king he has not taken care of us
his parents summoned kosthila and said
call our son kosthila
master if that is how you feel you should keep half of this village and i shall keep claim to the other half
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement i shall give sarika to him as a wife
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement
fool what do you know
ignoring what he said they gave sarika to the brahmin tisya as a wife
in a lavish ceremony tisya took sarika as his bride
the young brahmin kosthila thought
this insult is all due to my lack of learning
he thought what does the brahmin tisya know
he knows lokayata philosophy he asked around
gentlemen where is the lokayata philosophy known
in the south
gentlemen who knows the lokayata philosophy
on arrival he inquired
he was told he set out on the journey for the south to learn lokayata philosophy
the wanderers
he went to them and said
i seek to serve you gentlemen
why so that i may grasp the lokayata philosophy
in that case i shall go forth
so he let his fingernails grow extraordinarily long
and for this he became known as the wanderer dirghanakha he who has long fingernails
when sarika challenged her husband tisya he vanquished her
later as tisya and sarika sported made love
and indulged all their desires a sentient being in search of his final rebirth
who had grasped the essence of liberation
who had turned to nirvana and away from samsara
who had seen that all births end in death who did not seek to be reborn
and who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered sarikas womb
we do not teach lokayata philosophy to householders
sarika dreamed that a man carrying a torch rent and entered her belly she climbed to a mountain peak
she moved through the sky above an assembly of great men prostrated to her
she then told tisya about her dream
though tisya was expert at interpreting dreams and omens
he consulted other brahmins who interpreted them
what does it portend he asked
after his birth sarika said to tisya
if we present this brahmin boy to his grandfather he will give him a name
after eight or nine months
with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasol long arms a broad forehead
eyebrows that met and a prominent nose
a boy was born
he thought it is because of the being who has entered her womb
the next time tisya and sarika engaged in debate sarika vanquished him
making him wonder if i have vanquished her in the past what now has allowed her to vanquish me
an assembly of great men prostrated to me these statements indicate her son will go forth and become a great saint who perfects his vow
i climbed to a mountain peak i moved through the sky above
it portends that after twice eight years he will have studied the aindra school of grammar and will vanquish all opponents
her statement a man carrying a torch rent and entered my belly indicates a son will be born
they replied master that is an excellent portent
if my brahmin wife has had such a dream
and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others
his father made him study all fields of knowledge
at another time when he was reciting the vedas with his father he asked
father what is the meaning of this statement
son even i do not know the meaning of this statement
and thus by the age of sixteen he had studied the aindra school of grammar and could vanquish all opponents
but these rudiments of mantra have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages
nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them
tisya was delighted and in his delight thought
this is what a son should do
he should carry on his fathers tradition or
develop his insight even further
when the young brahmin upatisya taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite brahminic mantras
he summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
explaining their meaning and etymologies
he shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahminic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to upatisya
were he to accomplish only this this brahmin boys insight would surpass my own
this is what such statements mean
father do you think there is no meaning to these rudiments of mantra which have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins
in the village of kasthavata
there lived a royal priest named potalaka who was wealthy with many riches and goods
he took a wife of equal caste
and with her sported
made love and indulged all his desires
after their sporting lovemaking
and the indulgence of all their desires resulted in no child male or female
the childless couple badly wanting a child propitiated siva varuna kubera sakra brahma and others
among the different gods were gods of park shrines gods of the forest
gods of crossroads
gods of intersections
gods who take votive offerings
there is a saying boys and girls are born in the world because they are prayed for
but that is not so for if it were then each and every man would have a thousand sons as do the kings of the world
rather boys and girls are born when three circumstances are present
what are those three
the mother and father feel desire and couple
it is the right time and the mother is ovulating
and a spirit is near and wants to be reborn
and so it is that boys and girls are born when those three circumstances are present
certain women endowed with natural intelligence have five unique qualities
and who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered his wifes womb
who had seen that all births end in death who did not seek to be reborn
who had turned to nirvana and away from samsara
a being in search of his final rebirth who had grasped the essence of liberation
as potalaka sat engrossed in prayer
with holdings both vast and extensive with riches to rival vaisravana
what are the five
they know when a man feels desire and when he does not
they know when the time comes
and when they are ovulating
if it is a boy he lies with his head to the right side of the womb
if it is a girl she lies with her head to the left side of the womb
they know when they have conceived they know whence the conceived child came
and they know whether it is a boy or a girl
delighted potalakas wife joyfully told her husband
at last i shall look on the face of the son i have wanted for so long
may we get along and not disagree
may he carry on my work and
having been nurtured nurture in return
may he enjoy his inheritance and ensure that my line lasts long
on the doctors advice her food was not to be too bitter too sour
too salty too sweet
too spicy or too astringent
and so she was given food that was not bitter sour salty sweet spicy or astringent
her body was festooned in garlands necklaces and jewelry like a goddess at play in a pleasure garden
when it was hot she was given what she needed for the heat
she moved from bed to throne
from the time the sun rises to the time it sets there shall be no challenger to equal you
vinayavastu
dulwa shi
when our time comes and we die may he make the appropriate offerings neither too few nor too many
and may he dedicate the merit he thus accrues to us by name saying may this merit follow the two of them wherever they be born wherever they go
knowing she was with child to ensure she carried the child to term he installed his wife on the top story of their mansion where he saw that she was tended to and did not come to harm when it was cold she was given what she needed for the cold
son of a lord i am with child
from pedestal to pedestal the soles of her feet never touching the floor
and she never heard anything even slightly unpleasant
after eight or nine months had passed a boy was born well proportioned pleasing to the eye handsome radiant with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasol long arms a broad forehead eyebrows that met and a prominent nose
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style during which time they chose a name for the boy
as this boy had come to them from the lap of the gods
they thought the young brahmin should be named kolita born from the lap
and so he was named kolita
also because he was a descendent of mudgala they thought the young brahmin should be named maudgalyayana son of mudgalas descendants
and so he was named maudgalyayana
thus it was that some knew the young brahmin as maudgalyayana
while others knew him as kolita
the young brahmin kolita was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle him
two to breastfeed him
two to change his diapers
and two to play with him
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
when he was old enough he was introduced to letters
number names calculation counting by hand and how to exclude
to add to leave and to parse
once he had mastered letters
he was instructed in the ways of brahmins
their conduct ritual purity and observances
the handling of ashes
the handling of ritual vases
and the handling of sites
hand gestures
turbans
offering praise
and salutations
the rgveda
the yajurveda
the samaveda
and the atharvaveda
and a brahmins six dutiesmaking ritual sacrifices
officiating over ritual sacrifices
studying
teaching
giving
and receiving
he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
and with his blazing intelligence
he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others
his father made him study all fields of knowledge
once when he was reciting the vedas with his father he asked
father what does this statement mean
son even i dont know the meaning of this statement
sages of the past praised proclaimed and correctly applied these rudiments of mantra
but nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them
potalaka was delighted and in his delight thought
this is what a son should do
the young brahmin maudgalyayana then taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite the brahminic mantras
the five hundred young brahmins were in the habit
he should carry on his fathers tradition or develop his insight even further were he to accomplish only that
this brahmin boys insight would surpass my own
potalaka shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahminic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to maudgalyayana
this is what such statements mean and he proceeded to explain
father do you think there is no meaning to these rudiments of mantra which have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
visiting the city
or collecting wood for use in fire pujas
once when not occupied with their studies
the students of the young brahmin upatisya walked reciting mantras on their way to the city
meanwhile trailing behind the students of the young brahmin maudgalyayana walked reciting mantras on their way to the city
when the students of the young brahmin maudgalyayana heard the students of the young brahmin upatisya reciting the rudiments of mantra they asked
why do you recite the rudiments of mantra in such a debased way
the rudiments of mantra should be recited as we do
in the village of nalada lives the brahmin tisya
we have learned them from his son the young brahmin upatisya
and from whom did you learn these rudiments of mantra
in the village of kasthavata there lives a royal priest named potalaka
we have learned them from his son the young brahmin kolita
with that the young brahmin students of upatisya became dispirited upset and daunted
from whom did you learn these rudiments of mantra
they went to upatisya who saw them off in the distance and asked
what troubles you young brahmins
your master is never wrong
then he spoke in verse
after they explained the situation at length upatisya said
on hearing of the other both kolita and upatisya formed a singular desire to meet the other upatisya went to his father and said
he too then spoke the verse
those things you feel from within are clearly seen from without
they went to kolita who too on seeing them off in the distance asked
you cannot mask your voice your complexion or your mien
young brahmins clearly something troubles you
after they explained the situation at length he said
young brahmins allow me to explain
although the rudiments of mantra should be recited in the manner we have recited them
that young brahmin upatisya is wise for he has he summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
although the rudiments of mantra should be recited in the manner those young brahmins recite them
i have summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
explaining their meaning and etymologies the students of kolita had also become dispirited upset and daunted
father i wish to visit the village of kasthavata
son go and join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka
a short time later a small task came up prompting king bimbisara to say to prince ajatasatru
some time later in rajagrha the feast day of the naga kings giri and valguka approached
as the day neared king bimbisara wondered whether he should join in the festivities himself as was his wont or send prince ajatasatru in his stead
son is he wealthier than you
father he is not wealthier than i
it is rather that he is wiser
father i wish to visit the village of nalada for there lives a brahmin tisya whose son is called upatisya i shall go to see him
kolita also went to his father and said
for there lives a royal priest named potalaka whose son is called kolita i shall go to see him
son is he wiser than you father he is not wiser than i it is rather that he is wealthier
when the brahmin potalaka heard that king bimbisara had sent prince ajatasatru to join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka he thought
prince ajatasatru will become king once his father dies and kolita will become royal priest when i die
when the music began the dancers sang in totaka meter
when upatisya arrived he passed the kings and the royal priests seats placed a small stick and vase on the seat for the reigning champion and sat down on the challengers seat
when the brahmin tisya heard that king bimbisara had sent prince ajatasatru to join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka he too said to upatisya
thus their acquaintance will in time bear fruit he said to kolita
on arriving he left the kings seat be and sat on the royal priests seat
the people began to dance and sing
while the two young brahmins sat in repose
when the assembled crowd saw this they exclaimed
as the music wound down and the people went off dancing and singing
kolita asked upatisya
either those two young brahmins are fools or theyre unflappable
upatisya said to kolita
come join me as we have faith in only what is perfect let us go forth from home into homelessness
and all bodies but impermanent
all songs nonsense
all dance a competition
kolita replied in verse
all adornment is a weight
upatisya replied in verse
what wise man would not be vigilant
people know me thus
upatisya recited a verse
when a tree rots
what use has it for blossoms and boughs
when a person dies
what use has he for possessions
the young brahmin kolita went to his parents and said
father mother please listen
as i have faith in only what is perfect i shall go forth from home into homelessness
son the royal priesthood for which you have made offerings to the gods performed fire puja
and suffered through austerities is within reach having been born into a caste borne about by elephants why would you renounce it
kolita spoke in verse
to live in the forest clad in bark or grass eating roots and fruit among beasts is best
fearing the future
the wise refuse to kill imprison or torture for temporal power
his parents replied
son you are our only boy beloved handsome patient and agreeable to the eye
even if you were to die we would fight to keep you with us
why then do you think wed let you go while youre still alive
father mother it is best you let me go
for if you do not from this day forth i shall neither eat your food nor honor you
dear boy we will not let you leave so long as we live you will remain within sight do not think of disobeying
housing disputes and schisms in the sangha

another made a pledge to become his student as he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached rajagrha
he saluted mathara and asked
excellent my son you should do just that for that is a brahmins duty
on the way they had the following conversation

and he proceeded to explain

potalaka too was delighted he sat straight up raised his right hand and exclaimed with great joy
how should they be recited
not to know him is not to know the sun or the moon
what troubles you young brahmins your master is never wrong
explaining their meaning and etymologies
some are greater due to pedigree others because of age or riches

did it seem to you that the dances were well danced the songs well sung and the music well played
it seemed so to those who saw and heard them
if it is true that those who withdraw into repose do not see how then do they not hear
in a crowd of people destined for death who laugh and flirt though their dead skin and dead flesh will die
are you upatisya
are you kolita
come join me as we have faith in only what is perfect let us go forth from home into homelessness
i must first consult my parents
dear boy we will not let you leave so long as we live you will remain within sight do not think of disobeying
kolita refused food for one day
then for a second and for a third until the sixth day
at that point kolitas parents went to him and said dear boy please listen
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
it is hard to live the holy life
it is hard to live in solitude it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
dear boy kolita come home there is pleasure to be had while living here too
here too you may give generously here too you may act meritoriously
despite their pleading kolita remained silent
kolitas parents again entreated him a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen
dear boy kolita come home there is pleasure to be had while living here too
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures

it is hard to live in solitude it is hard to be happy all on your own
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
here too you may give generously here too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him a second and a third time kolita remained silent
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and dont know what it is to suffer it is hard to live the holy life
dear boy please listen
at this kolitas relatives went to him and said
family come talk sense into our dear boy kolita
kolitas parents then enjoined his relatives
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
despite their pleading kolita did not say a thing
kolitas relatives again entreated him a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
it is hard to live the holy life it is hard to live in solitude

yet though they thus pleaded with him a second time and a third time kolita still remained silent
kolitas parents then enjoined his childhood friends you must come
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and do not know what it is to suffer
dear boy listen
at this the young brahmin kolitas childhood friends went to him and said
talk sense into our dear boy kolita
it is hard to live the holy life it is hard to live in solitude
it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying

you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures

dear boy kolita come home there is also pleasure to be had while living among your relatives
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him kolita remained silent
his childhood friends again entreated kolita a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him a second and a third time kolita still remained silent
kolitas childhood friends then went to his parents and said
father mother please listen
what good can come from the death of the serene youth kolita
the wise have praised going forth so if going forth makes him happy then at least you will see him alive
if he isnt happy he can always give up the life of a sage
and since he will have no home but yours it is better that you let him go forth
kolitas parents then asked kolita
dear boy kolita do you think it better to go forth than to remain at home
father mother it is not good for me to live at home it is good for me to go forth
well then dear boy kolita know that the time for such a change has come
having obtained his parents consent the young brahmin kolita slowly regained his strength vigor and determination by drinking rice gruel
he left the village of kasthavata and set out for the village of nalada
as the young brahmin upatisya enjoyed solitude he had gone to live in the forest
where he gave instruction to five hundred young brahmins in the reciting of mantras
in time the young brahmin kolita reached the village of nalada and asked upatisyas parents
father mother where is upatisya
father mother where is upatisya
they replied upatisya enjoys solitude so he has gone to live in the forest
where he instructs five hundred young brahmins in the reciting of mantras
kolita went to upatisya and said
come join me upatisya as we have faith in only what is perfect we shall go forth from home into the homelessness
did your parents give their consent
they did
young brahmin please stay until i have asked my parents
upatisya went to his parents and said
young brahmin i will see that they give their consent right away and return
upatisya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent how long will it be until you have consent
father mother please listen
as i have faith in only what is perfect i shall go forth from home into homelessness
son is it good for you to go forth
father mother it is good for me to go forth
then go forth son
upatisya went to kolita and said
come kolita as we have faith in only what is perfect we shall go forth from home into homelessness
while i was hindered by light bindings powerless weak and perishable
you were hindered by heavy bindings tight secure and imperishable
upatisya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent how did you get the consent of yours so quickly
the venerable sariputra had gone forth in five hundred previous lives because he had made this prayer
may i be born not in a wealthy house nor in one that is poor let it be rather in a house of moderate means and always among many renunciants
kolita said to upatisya
young brahmin as we are wellknown brahmins we cannot join just any renunciant order
meanwhile there were six tirthika teachers living in rajagrha who entertained the conceit of omniscience although they were not omniscient
we must properly scrutinize the different renunciant orders and only then join one with that they made their way to rajagrha
purana kasyapa gosaliputra the wanderer sanjayin son of vairatti ajita of the hair shawl
kakuda a descendant of katyayana and jnatiputra the nirgrantha
the young brahmins upatisya and kolita went to purana kasyapa and asked him
sir what is your approach to the dharma
what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living a holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied purana this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
there is nothing to alms oblations ritual sacrifices good deeds or bad deeds
there are no results or fruitions from performing good deeds or bad deeds
there is no present life there is no afterlife
there is no mother there is no father
sentient beings are not born miraculously
in the world there are no arhats who have reached perfection who have entered perfection
who can knowingly say that through their heightened insight they have seen this and future lives and proclaim we have overcome birth
we have lived the holy life we have done what needed to be done
