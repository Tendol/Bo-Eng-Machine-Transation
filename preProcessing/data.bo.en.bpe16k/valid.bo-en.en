and so the boy was named pradyota
and so each king attributed the light to the birth of his own son
so great was its strength that darkness everywhere even the pitchblack darkness of dark places dark from never knowing the light of the sun and moon was filled with a vast light
though each attributed it to his own son
it was not so
for all that occurred occurred because of the bodhisattva
on the very same day that prince bimbisara was born
five hundred sons of five hundred ministers were also born
and were given names appropriate to their patrilineage
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
these arts and skills were also mastered by the five hundred sons of the five hundred ministers
bimbisaras father enrolled him in the eighteen guilds due to which he was named and became known as bimbisara of the guilds
later prince bimbisara ventured into the countryside astride an elephant
where he saw the king of angas officers collecting tributes and taxes prompting him to inquire of his men
gentlemen for whom are these tributes and taxes being collected
what will we be offered tribute
when the officers were summoned he said
if i too have been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king
why is it you are collecting tributes and taxes here
gentlemen the king of anga has been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king
i forbid you to collect tributes and taxes from this day forth
gentlemen the prince doesnt understand the situation continue to collect tributes and taxes as you have done before
they went to king mahapadma and said
your majesty when we officers of the king of anga were collecting tributes and taxes
prince bimbisara stopped us from doing so
shall we collect them or not
the prince fails to appreciate the situation they thought let us go submit the matter to king mahapadma
they had begun their collection again
when prince bimbisara spotted them on their way back from the countryside and said
gentlemen have i not already prohibited you from collecting tributes and taxes
why are you collecting them again
you are to desist fail to desist and i shall close the borders
frightened they thought
the prince is dangerous and ruthless
in time he may pose a serious risk to us
we must go warn the king of anga
they went before the king of anga and said
your majesty as officers of the court
we were collecting tributes and taxes on your behalf when king mahapadmas son prince bimbisara stopped us
if your majesty ignores the princes actions
he may in time pose a serious risk to us
then they spoke in verse
when a tree is small fingernails may fell it
yet when the tree is large
even a hundred axes may fail
son we are tributaries
they have sent me a letter expressing their anger
son why did you stop the king of angas officers from collecting tributes and taxes
then he summoned prince bimbisara and said
he sat and sat absorbed in thought
king mahapadma heard this letter read and was troubled head in hands
the king of anga sent a letter to king mahapadma send prince bimbisara with his sword hung from his neck
or prepare your pyre and shroud for i myself will come
and we too have been crowned and anointed ksatriya kings
why do we offer tribute and taxes to him
give me an army of just four divisions your majesty
and i will meet the king of anga in battle
king mahapadma then sent a message to the king of anga saying you had best hope all the power forces will and authority you possess do not fail you
the king of anga found this message intolerable and commanded his ministers
gentlemen lay waste to those lands
call up the four branches of the armed forces
if he falls then all fall
as spokes at a hubs collapse
in whose house dwells glory
it is he we should protect
then they said in verse
gentlemen what if i were to meet the king of anga in battle what would you do
prince your struggle shall be our struggle they responded
prince bimbisara gathered the five hundred ministers sons and said
he summoned prince bimbisara and gave him charge over the four branches of the armed forces
king mahapadma was troubled by this news and head in hands sat and sat absorbed in thought
now you must do all you can to protect me
whatever your majestys plight may be that too shall be ours
wherever your majestys foot may fall there shall we bow our heads
the four branches of the armed forces were then called up
and they set out from rajagrha
when king mahapadma who sat shut up in his upper citadel surrounded by his council saw them depart he asked his ministers
gentlemen whose army is this
your majesty it is prince bimbisaras
gentlemen it is awesome to behold
hence the prince was named and became known as bimbisara of the army
some knew him as bimbisara of the guilds while some knew him as bimbisara of the army
prince bimbisara said to the five hundred sons of the ministers
gentlemen this king of anga is belligerent ruthless and his military might is great so we cannot meet him in battle
therefore we will sneak in overrun his exposed camp and kill him while their guard is down and their armor off
they overran the king of angas exposed camp while their guard was down and their armor off sneaking up and killing him
the four branches of the king of angas armed forces scattered to the four directions
prince bimbisara sent mounted emissaries in the four directions with the message
gentlemen you have been crowned and anointed kings of ksatriya
and i too have been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king so return
i for my part will assume the reins of power here
and so prince bimbisara assumed the reins of power under him the kingdom prospered and thrived crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people
once king mahapadmas time had come
the ministers of rajagrha sent a message to king bimbisara saying your majesty your fathers time has come
in a great coronation ceremony the ministers of rajagrha and magadha granted him sovereignty over the lands of anga and magadha
under king bimbisaras rule the kingdoms of anga and magadha prospered and thrived crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people
seek always to protect life
when the wise look at both
they see land but not life can be found again
with that thought he hung his sword from his neck in surrender and came out
son you must take the reins of power there
your majesty tell me what else needs to be done and i shall see to it
pleased king mahapadma sent prince bimbisara a parasol a turban and a coronet with the message
your majesty i have slain the king of anga and campa is now in my hands
with the king of anga slain campa fell into prince bimbisaras hands at which point he sent a message to king mahapadma saying
when land and life are threatened
it distressed the steward of campa to hear this and he thought of this verse
it is i who has brought your lord to this state
come out immediately and i shall look favorably upon you
fail to appear and you too will soon find yourself in this state
when at last prince bimbisara reached campa
the prince fixed the king of angas head onto a long pole and displayed it saying
he rid the land of brigands thieves famine and illness and brought a wealth of rice sugar cane cattle and buffalo
devout the just king ruled justly
there was a young brahmin who desiring and in search of esoteric instruction left the middle country and went to the south
there in a land not his own lived a teacher of brahmins who had mastered the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
the young brahmin went to see this teacher of brahmins serene the young brahmin bowed his head calmly and sat off to one side
the brahmin teacher warmly greeted him with words of welcome and asked
young brahmin where have you come from and what do you desire
i hail from the middle country and i seek to serve at the feet of a master
why so that i may recite the vedas
excellent my son you should do just that
for that is a brahmins duty
and so the young brahmin began to recite the vedas with the teacher of brahmins
the brahmins students were in the habit
on the way they had the following conversation
to begin with let us share where we come from from which land we hail
one young brahmin responded
i am from the east
once when not occupied with their studies they went to collect wood for fire pujas
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
he completely pacified conflict aggressors and enemies from without as well as disturbances from within
said another
i am from the south
i am from the west
i am from the north
the young brahmin then said
i am from the middle country
to him they said
sir we have seen and heard of all those other countries
but have neither seen nor heard of the middle country
in the east they are wise
in the south they are cunning
in the west they stir division
in the north they speak roughly
and then they added this verse
young brahmin they asked what is the middle country like
gentlemen the middle country is the best of all lands
abounding in rice sugar cane cattle and buffalo
at one point where sages are known to gather the river flows through eighteen bends
there sages seek to bodily rise to the heavens through their practice of austerities
young brahmin having met you we have another question
do you have men counted as learned in the middle country
young brahmin you did say that
thronging with hundreds of honest women and filled with upstanding men devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
the river ganga bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shores
young brahmin are there any in the middle country like our master the wisest of philosophers
gentlemen in the middle country the philosophers are such that our teacher could not even look them in the face
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
on hearing the young brahmin speak so highly of the middle country
they were moved by the desire to visit it
the young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pujas
bearing their loads of wood they came to the house in which the teacher of brahmins lived
on arriving they set their loads of wood off to one side
went to him and said
master please listen
the young brahmin from the middle country speaks so highly of it that we are moved by the desire to visit
the brahmin said
boys would you visit every place of which you hear
my sons do i say i am the one and only philosopher on this earth
that there are no other philosophers
after all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after another
along the way he defeated an opponent in debate and then bound him to his chariot
he poured ashes from a pot on anothers head
another steered clear of him like a crow does an archery range
another received him with parasols victory banners and standards
the brahmin thought
why bother pulling off the branches petals and leaves while leaving the root
since all worthy opponents and anyone counted as learned will be close to the king
it is the king i shall see
with that the brahmin went to see king bimbisara
on arriving he wished king bimbisara success and long life
took a place off to one side and addressed him
your majesty from my guru i have received a few teachings
and so i seek to settle a matter in debate with an opponent in your majestys presence
the king asked his ministers
gentlemen are there any opponents in my kingdom capable of settling a matter in debate with this brahmin
he has put together a work known as matharas treatise
summon master mathara
as you wish your majesty
mathara received the summons and went to see king bimbisara
on arrival he wished king bimbisara success and long life then took a place off to one side
with blazing intelligence this capable man illuminates his own assertions and smashes those of others
your majesty in the village of nalada there is a brahmin known as mathara
who has mastered the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
having collected their things the brahmin set off with the young brahmins for the middle country
in that case my sons let us gather our funds robes walking staffs ladles funnels and washing bowls and go to the middle country
as the brahmin was attached to his students and his circle of students was small he said to the young brahmins
we will go to the middle country
we will make a name for ourselves and find our fortune too
we will defeat opponents
we will serve the wisest of philosophers
we will see that country yet master if only for a short while we will bathe on the banks of the river
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
master according to this young brahmin in the middle country the philosophers are such that you our teacher could not even look them in the face
since you seem to derive so much pleasure from hearing of other countries i would suggest you not visit those places you hear about
the ministers said
this is the master your majesty
the king greeted him with words of welcome and asked
master can you settle a matter in debate in my presence with this brahmin
replied mathara
i as a capable man shall do as the king pleases
the king ordered the ministers
gentlemen prepare the debate arena
and assign the disputants their roles
the ministers prepared the debate arena and assigned the disputants their roles
the ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and asked
your majesty who would you have defend a position first
this brahmin is a visitor so have him defend a position first
having been assigned to defend a position first the brahmin proceeded to recite five hundred stanzas
mathara repeated them and then said
this position of yours is devoid of logic
it is inconsistent and incoherent
the brahmin remained silent as mathara pointed out the positions faults
that the brahmin had no confidence to respond was damning and among the reasons he was vanquished
the king asked the ministers
gentlemen who won
mathara your majesty
this pleased the king who straightened up extended his right arm
it is a fine discovery for me to find this wisest of philosophers in my kingdom
master where do you live
your majesty in nalada
go and let that village be your victors prize
mathara was thrilled delighted and overjoyed
surrounded by learned men
he returned to his village
and since the world desires success and distrusts failure several brahmins pressed their daughters on him in marriage
mathara then took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all their desires
the wife with whom he sported made love and indulged all desires gave birth to a son with an extraordinarily long torso
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style
during which time they chose a name for the boy
the relatives said
since this boy has an extraordinarily long torso he should be named kosthila long torso
the young brahmin was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle him
two to breastfeed him
two to change his diapers
and two to play with him
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
when he was old enough he was introduced to letters
he was instructed in the ways of brahmins
number names calculation counting by hand how to exclude to add and to leave and to parse until he had mastered reading
their conduct ritual purity and observances the handling of ashes the handling of ritual vases and the handling of sites
hand gestures turbans offering praise and salutations
the rgveda the yajurveda the samaveda and the atharvaveda
and a brahmins six duties
making ritual sacrifices officiating over ritual sacrifices studying teaching giving and receiving
he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions
and vanquish those of others
her father taught her how to combine letters into words so she became proficient in reading
later when the young brahmin kosthila was debating sarika sarika vanquished him
and their father said to kosthila
son if you are a male how has a female vanquished you
once im gone the spoils ive won in debate will be taken away
at that the young brahmin kosthila desiring and in search of esoteric instruction set off from the middle country for the south
there in a country not his own lived a brahmin named tisya who was learned in lokayata philosophy
a teacher of brahmins and a master of the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
kosthila went to see the brahmin tisya
serene the young brahmin kosthila bowed at tisyas feet and sat off to one side
tisya warmly greeted kosthila with words of welcome asking
young brahmin where have you come from and what do you desire
i hail from the middle country
and i seek to serve at the feet of the master
why
so that i may uphold the lokayata philosophy
and so the young brahmin kosthila began to study lokayata philosophy in the presence of the brahmin tisya
the girl sarika was nurtured and grew
the relatives said
since this girl has eyes like a sari this girl should be given the name sarika
during which time they chose a name for the girl
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate her birth in grand style
the wife with whom mathara sported made love and indulged all desires again gave birth this time to a girl with eyes like a sari bird
the brahmins students were in the habit
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
visiting the city or collecting wood for use in fire pujas
once when not occupied with their studies they went to collect wood for fire pujas
i am from the east
one young brahmin responded
said another
i am from the south
i am from the west
i am from the north
the young brahmin then said
i am from the middle country
sir we have seen and heard of all those other countries but have neither seen nor heard of the middle country
to him they said
in the east they are wise

the river ganga bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shores
at one point where sages are known to gather the river flows through eighteen bends
there sages seek to bodily rise to the heavens through their practice of austerities
young brahmin having met you we have another question
do you have men counted as learned in the middle country
gentlemen from the first did i not say gentlemen the middle country is filled with upstanding men
devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
young brahmin you did say that
young brahmin are there any in the middle country like our master the wisest of philosophers
on hearing the young brahmin speak so highly of the middle country
they were moved by the desire to visit it
the young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pujas

on arriving they set their loads of wood off to one side went to him and said

the brahmin tisya said
boys would you visit every place of which you hear
after all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after another
my sons do i say i am the one and only philosopher on this earth that there are no other philosophers
master according to this young brahmin in the middle country the philosophers are such that you our teacher could not even look them in the face
since you seem to derive so much pleasure from hearing of other countries i would suggest you not visit those places you hear about
gentlemen in the middle country the philosophers are such that our teacher could not even look them in the face so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
we will serve the wisest of philosophers
we will see that country yet master if only for a short while
we will bathe on the banks of the river
we will defeat opponents
we will make a name for ourselves and find our fortune too
we will go to the middle country
as the brahmin was attached to his students
and his circle of students was small he said to the young brahmins
in that case my sons let us gather our funds robes walking staffs ladles funnels and washing bowls and go to the middle country
having collected their things the brahmin set off with the young brahmins for the middle country
along the way he defeated an opponent in debate and then bound him to his chariot
he poured ashes from a pot on anothers head
another steered clear of him like a crow does an archery range
another received him with parasols victory banners and standards
another made a pledge to become his student
as he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached rajagrha
the brahmin tisya thought
why bother pulling off the branches petals and leaves while leaving the root
on arriving he wished the king success and long life
took a place off to one side and addressed him
your majesty from my guru i have received a few teachings
in time the brahmin tisya went to see king bimbisara
it is the king i shall see
since all worthy opponents and anyone counted as learned will be close to the king
and so i seek to settle a matter in debate with an opponent in your majestys presence
summon master mathara
the king asked the ministers gentlemen where is master mathara in nalada your majesty
as you wish your majesty on receiving the summons mathara went to see king bimbisara
on arrival he wished the king success and long life then took a place off to one side
the ministers said
this is the master your majesty
the king greeted him with words of welcome and asked
master can you settle a matter in debate in my presence with this brahmin tisya
replied mathara
i as a capable man shall do as the king pleases
the brahmin tisya repeated them and
this position of yours is devoid of logic
it is inconsistent and incoherent
the other brahmin remained silent as tisya pointed out the texts faults
i shall focus on an old text and with that he recited five hundred stanzas
this brahmin tisya is clearly acquainted with new treatises so i cannot debate him on them
the brahmin mathara thought
as the brahmin mathara is the elder i ask that you have him defend a position first
said he brahmin tisya
the brahmin tisya is a visitor so have him defend a position first
the ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and asked
the ministers prepared the debate arena and assigned the disputants their roles
the king ordered the ministers
gentlemen prepare the debate arena and assign the disputants their roles
that mathara had no confidence to respond was damning and among the reasons he was vanquished
the king asked the ministers
gentlemen who won
the brahmin tisya your majesty
gentlemen give the brahmin tisya a victors prize
therefore make the village of nalada the standard victors prize
take it from the brahmin mathara
and give it to this brahmin
and if any other should best tisya then award it to the victor
the village was then taken from the brahmin mathara and given to the brahmin tisya
the brahmin mathara thought
though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i shall go elsewhere he said to his wife
noble lady though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i shall go elsewhere so pack up our household
with that they began packing up their household
when their relatives heard that the master mathara was leaving
they went to see him and asked
master why are you packing up your household
gentlemen though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
therefore i shall go elsewhere
mathara replied in verse
better to live in anothers land than to be oppressed in ones own
there where a man lives free is the place he finds his home and friends
master do not leave for other parts remain for a while at your leisure in the home of your relatives
if you give a prize to everyone who wins a debate before long your lands of anga and magadha will themselves be victors prizes
they replied
gentlemen said the king that is what i shall do
when the brahmin tisya heard that the master mathara was to leave
he went to him and said
i have come only for a short time and before long am certain to go
let this remain your victors prize
do not leave you must stay
mathara replied i intend to leave young brahmin
mathara thought
though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i will give sarika to him as a wife mathara then said to his wife
noble lady though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
why would you give sarika to him in marriage
his parents said
anyone else in our position would try to take his life if he has robbed us so
hasnt he robbed us of our livelihood
father mother how could i accept this enemy into our family
i shall give sarika to him as a wife kosthila replied
son though we have done much for this king he has not taken care of us
his parents summoned kosthila and said
call our son kosthila
master if that is how you feel you should keep half of this village and i shall keep claim to the other half
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement i shall give sarika to him as a wife
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement
fool what do you know
ignoring what he said they gave sarika to the brahmin tisya as a wife
in a lavish ceremony tisya took sarika as his bride
the young brahmin kosthila thought
this insult is all due to my lack of learning
he thought what does the brahmin tisya know
he knows lokayata philosophy he asked around
gentlemen where is the lokayata philosophy known
in the south
gentlemen who knows the lokayata philosophy
on arrival he inquired
he was told he set out on the journey for the south to learn lokayata philosophy
the wanderers
he went to them and said
i seek to serve you gentlemen
why so that i may grasp the lokayata philosophy
in that case i shall go forth
so he let his fingernails grow extraordinarily long
and for this he became known as the wanderer dirghanakha he who has long fingernails
when sarika challenged her husband tisya he vanquished her
later as tisya and sarika sported made love
and indulged all their desires a sentient being in search of his final rebirth
who had grasped the essence of liberation
who had turned to nirvana and away from samsara
who had seen that all births end in death who did not seek to be reborn
and who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered sarikas womb
we do not teach lokayata philosophy to householders
sarika dreamed that a man carrying a torch rent and entered her belly she climbed to a mountain peak
she moved through the sky above an assembly of great men prostrated to her
she then told tisya about her dream
though tisya was expert at interpreting dreams and omens
he consulted other brahmins who interpreted them
what does it portend he asked
after his birth sarika said to tisya
if we present this brahmin boy to his grandfather he will give him a name
after eight or nine months
with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasol long arms a broad forehead
eyebrows that met and a prominent nose
a boy was born
he thought it is because of the being who has entered her womb
the next time tisya and sarika engaged in debate sarika vanquished him
making him wonder if i have vanquished her in the past what now has allowed her to vanquish me
an assembly of great men prostrated to me these statements indicate her son will go forth and become a great saint who perfects his vow
i climbed to a mountain peak i moved through the sky above
it portends that after twice eight years he will have studied the aindra school of grammar and will vanquish all opponents
her statement a man carrying a torch rent and entered my belly indicates a son will be born
they replied master that is an excellent portent
if my brahmin wife has had such a dream
and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others
his father made him study all fields of knowledge
at another time when he was reciting the vedas with his father he asked
father what is the meaning of this statement
son even i do not know the meaning of this statement
and thus by the age of sixteen he had studied the aindra school of grammar and could vanquish all opponents
but these rudiments of mantra have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages
nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them
tisya was delighted and in his delight thought
this is what a son should do
he should carry on his fathers tradition or
develop his insight even further
when the young brahmin upatisya taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite brahminic mantras
he summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
explaining their meaning and etymologies
he shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahminic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to upatisya
were he to accomplish only this this brahmin boys insight would surpass my own
this is what such statements mean
father do you think there is no meaning to these rudiments of mantra which have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins
in the village of kasthavata
there lived a royal priest named potalaka who was wealthy with many riches and goods
he took a wife of equal caste
and with her sported
made love and indulged all his desires
after their sporting lovemaking
and the indulgence of all their desires resulted in no child male or female
the childless couple badly wanting a child propitiated siva varuna kubera sakra brahma and others
among the different gods were gods of park shrines gods of the forest
gods of crossroads
gods of intersections
gods who take votive offerings
there is a saying boys and girls are born in the world because they are prayed for
but that is not so for if it were then each and every man would have a thousand sons as do the kings of the world
rather boys and girls are born when three circumstances are present
what are those three
the mother and father feel desire and couple
it is the right time and the mother is ovulating
and a spirit is near and wants to be reborn
and so it is that boys and girls are born when those three circumstances are present
certain women endowed with natural intelligence have five unique qualities
and who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered his wifes womb
who had seen that all births end in death who did not seek to be reborn
who had turned to nirvana and away from samsara
a being in search of his final rebirth who had grasped the essence of liberation
as potalaka sat engrossed in prayer
with holdings both vast and extensive with riches to rival vaisravana
what are the five
they know when a man feels desire and when he does not
they know when the time comes
and when they are ovulating
if it is a boy he lies with his head to the right side of the womb
if it is a girl she lies with her head to the left side of the womb
they know when they have conceived they know whence the conceived child came
and they know whether it is a boy or a girl
delighted potalakas wife joyfully told her husband
at last i shall look on the face of the son i have wanted for so long
may we get along and not disagree
may he carry on my work and
having been nurtured nurture in return
may he enjoy his inheritance and ensure that my line lasts long
on the doctors advice her food was not to be too bitter too sour
too salty too sweet
too spicy or too astringent
and so she was given food that was not bitter sour salty sweet spicy or astringent
her body was festooned in garlands necklaces and jewelry like a goddess at play in a pleasure garden
when it was hot she was given what she needed for the heat
she moved from bed to throne
from the time the sun rises to the time it sets there shall be no challenger to equal you
vinayavastu
dulwa shi
when our time comes and we die may he make the appropriate offerings neither too few nor too many
and may he dedicate the merit he thus accrues to us by name saying may this merit follow the two of them wherever they be born wherever they go
knowing she was with child to ensure she carried the child to term he installed his wife on the top story of their mansion where he saw that she was tended to and did not come to harm when it was cold she was given what she needed for the cold
son of a lord i am with child
from pedestal to pedestal the soles of her feet never touching the floor
and she never heard anything even slightly unpleasant
after eight or nine months had passed a boy was born well proportioned pleasing to the eye handsome radiant with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasol long arms a broad forehead eyebrows that met and a prominent nose
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style during which time they chose a name for the boy
as this boy had come to them from the lap of the gods
they thought the young brahmin should be named kolita born from the lap
and so he was named kolita
also because he was a descendent of mudgala they thought the young brahmin should be named maudgalyayana son of mudgalas descendants
and so he was named maudgalyayana
thus it was that some knew the young brahmin as maudgalyayana
while others knew him as kolita
the young brahmin kolita was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle him
two to breastfeed him
two to change his diapers
and two to play with him
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
when he was old enough he was introduced to letters
number names calculation counting by hand and how to exclude
to add to leave and to parse
once he had mastered letters
he was instructed in the ways of brahmins
their conduct ritual purity and observances
the handling of ashes
the handling of ritual vases
and the handling of sites
hand gestures
turbans
offering praise
and salutations
the rgveda
the yajurveda

he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
and with his blazing intelligence
he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others
his father made him study all fields of knowledge
once when he was reciting the vedas with his father he asked
father what does this statement mean
son even i dont know the meaning of this statement
sages of the past praised proclaimed and correctly applied these rudiments of mantra
but nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them
potalaka was delighted and in his delight thought
this is what a son should do
the young brahmin maudgalyayana then taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite the brahminic mantras
the five hundred young brahmins were in the habit
he should carry on his fathers tradition or develop his insight even further were he to accomplish only that
this brahmin boys insight would surpass my own
potalaka shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahminic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to maudgalyayana
this is what such statements mean and he proceeded to explain
father do you think there is no meaning to these rudiments of mantra which have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
visiting the city
or collecting wood for use in fire pujas
once when not occupied with their studies
the students of the young brahmin upatisya walked reciting mantras on their way to the city
meanwhile trailing behind the students of the young brahmin maudgalyayana walked reciting mantras on their way to the city
when the students of the young brahmin maudgalyayana heard the students of the young brahmin upatisya reciting the rudiments of mantra they asked
why do you recite the rudiments of mantra in such a debased way
the rudiments of mantra should be recited as we do
in the village of nalada lives the brahmin tisya
we have learned them from his son the young brahmin upatisya
and from whom did you learn these rudiments of mantra
in the village of kasthavata there lives a royal priest named potalaka
we have learned them from his son the young brahmin kolita
with that the young brahmin students of upatisya became dispirited upset and daunted
from whom did you learn these rudiments of mantra
they went to upatisya who saw them off in the distance and asked
what troubles you young brahmins
your master is never wrong
then he spoke in verse
after they explained the situation at length upatisya said
on hearing of the other both kolita and upatisya formed a singular desire to meet the other upatisya went to his father and said
he too then spoke the verse
those things you feel from within are clearly seen from without
they went to kolita who too on seeing them off in the distance asked
you cannot mask your voice your complexion or your mien
young brahmins clearly something troubles you
after they explained the situation at length he said
young brahmins allow me to explain
although the rudiments of mantra should be recited in the manner we have recited them
that young brahmin upatisya is wise for he has he summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
although the rudiments of mantra should be recited in the manner those young brahmins recite them
i have summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
explaining their meaning and etymologies the students of kolita had also become dispirited upset and daunted
father i wish to visit the village of kasthavata
son go and join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka
a short time later a small task came up prompting king bimbisara to say to prince ajatasatru
some time later in rajagrha the feast day of the naga kings giri and valguka approached
as the day neared king bimbisara wondered whether he should join in the festivities himself as was his wont or send prince ajatasatru in his stead
son is he wealthier than you
father he is not wealthier than i
it is rather that he is wiser
father i wish to visit the village of nalada for there lives a brahmin tisya whose son is called upatisya i shall go to see him
kolita also went to his father and said
for there lives a royal priest named potalaka whose son is called kolita i shall go to see him
son is he wiser than you father he is not wiser than i it is rather that he is wealthier
when the brahmin potalaka heard that king bimbisara had sent prince ajatasatru to join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka he thought
prince ajatasatru will become king once his father dies and kolita will become royal priest when i die
when the music began the dancers sang in totaka meter
when upatisya arrived he passed the kings and the royal priests seats placed a small stick and vase on the seat for the reigning champion and sat down on the challengers seat
when the brahmin tisya heard that king bimbisara had sent prince ajatasatru to join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka he too said to upatisya
thus their acquaintance will in time bear fruit he said to kolita
on arriving he left the kings seat be and sat on the royal priests seat
the people began to dance and sing
while the two young brahmins sat in repose
when the assembled crowd saw this they exclaimed
as the music wound down and the people went off dancing and singing
kolita asked upatisya
either those two young brahmins are fools or theyre unflappable
upatisya said to kolita
come join me as we have faith in only what is perfect let us go forth from home into homelessness
and all bodies but impermanent
all songs nonsense
all dance a competition
kolita replied in verse
all adornment is a weight
upatisya replied in verse
what wise man would not be vigilant
people know me thus
upatisya recited a verse
when a tree rots
what use has it for blossoms and boughs
when a person dies
what use has he for possessions
the young brahmin kolita went to his parents and said
father mother please listen
as i have faith in only what is perfect i shall go forth from home into homelessness
son the royal priesthood for which you have made offerings to the gods performed fire puja
and suffered through austerities is within reach having been born into a caste borne about by elephants why would you renounce it
kolita spoke in verse
to live in the forest clad in bark or grass eating roots and fruit among beasts is best
fearing the future
the wise refuse to kill imprison or torture for temporal power
his parents replied
son you are our only boy beloved handsome patient and agreeable to the eye
even if you were to die we would fight to keep you with us
why then do you think wed let you go while youre still alive
father mother it is best you let me go
for if you do not from this day forth i shall neither eat your food nor honor you
dear boy we will not let you leave so long as we live you will remain within sight do not think of disobeying
housing disputes and schisms in the sangha

prince bimbisara was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle him two to breastfeed him two to change his diapers and two to play with him

having called up the four branches of the armed forcesthe elephant corps the cavalry the charioteer corps and the infantrythey began to lay waste to the land of magadha
the people of magadha sent a message to king mahapadma saying your majesty the king of anga has called up the four branches of his armed forcesthe elephant corps the cavalry the charioteer corps and the infantryand is laying waste to the lands of magadha
gentlemen i will support you
he whom the king of anga left to defend the city of campa
heard how the king of anga had been killed prompting him to close the gates and take cover within the walls of the fortress
visiting the city
or collecting wood for use in fire pujas
sons of kutsa sons of vatsa sons of sandili sons of bharadvaja sons of the five sons of the further five
gentlemen from the first did i not say gentlemen the middle country is filled with upstanding men devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
another made a pledge to become his student as he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached rajagrha
he saluted mathara and asked
excellent my son you should do just that for that is a brahmins duty
on the way they had the following conversation
sons of kutsa sons of vatsa sons of sandili sons of bharadvaja sons of the five sons of the further five to begin with let us share where we come from from which land we hail
majesty who would you have defend a position first
after they allowed his going forth he said
so long as i uphold the lokayata philosophy i will not cut my fingernails
well proportioned pleasing to the eye handsome radiant
giving and receiving he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
and he proceeded to explain
birth totem gods gods who adhere to the dharma and gods who always shadow you
and as it lies with its head to the right side of my womb it is sure to be a boy so pray be happy
potalaka too was delighted he sat straight up raised his right hand and exclaimed with great joy
how should they be recited
not to know him is not to know the sun or the moon
what troubles you young brahmins your master is never wrong
explaining their meaning and etymologies
some are greater due to pedigree others because of age or riches
but they all seek to sit at the doorstep of the learned
son if he should come here you should share your learning but you mustnt go to him
some are greater due to pedigree
others because of age or learning
but they all sit subservient at the doorstep of the rich
son go join the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka
there they will have arranged four seats one for the king one for the royal priest one for the challenger and one for the reigning champion
leave the kings seat be and take your place in the royal priests seat
leave the kings seat and the royal priests seat be but place a small stick and vase on the reigning champions seat before sitting down on the challengers seat
did it seem to you that the dances were well danced the songs well sung and the music well played
it seemed so to those who saw and heard them
if it is true that those who withdraw into repose do not see how then do they not hear
in a crowd of people destined for death who laugh and flirt though their dead skin and dead flesh will die
are you upatisya
are you kolita
come join me as we have faith in only what is perfect let us go forth from home into homelessness
i must first consult my parents
dear boy we will not let you leave so long as we live you will remain within sight do not think of disobeying
kolita refused food for one day
then for a second and for a third until the sixth day
at that point kolitas parents went to him and said dear boy please listen
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
it is hard to live the holy life
it is hard to live in solitude it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
dear boy kolita come home there is pleasure to be had while living here too
here too you may give generously here too you may act meritoriously
despite their pleading kolita remained silent
kolitas parents again entreated him a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen
dear boy kolita come home there is pleasure to be had while living here too
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
it is hard to live in solitude it is hard to be happy all on your own
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
here too you may give generously here too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him a second and a third time kolita remained silent
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and dont know what it is to suffer it is hard to live the holy life
dear boy please listen
at this kolitas relatives went to him and said
family come talk sense into our dear boy kolita
kolitas parents then enjoined his relatives
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
despite their pleading kolita did not say a thing
kolitas relatives again entreated him a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
it is hard to live the holy life it is hard to live in solitude
it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus pleaded with him a second time and a third time kolita still remained silent
kolitas parents then enjoined his childhood friends you must come
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and do not know what it is to suffer
dear boy listen
at this the young brahmin kolitas childhood friends went to him and said
talk sense into our dear boy kolita
it is hard to live the holy life it is hard to live in solitude
it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
dear boy kolita come home there is also pleasure to be had while living among your relatives
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him kolita remained silent
his childhood friends again entreated kolita a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him a second and a third time kolita still remained silent
kolitas childhood friends then went to his parents and said
father mother please listen
what good can come from the death of the serene youth kolita
the wise have praised going forth so if going forth makes him happy then at least you will see him alive
if he isnt happy he can always give up the life of a sage
and since he will have no home but yours it is better that you let him go forth
kolitas parents then asked kolita
dear boy kolita do you think it better to go forth than to remain at home
father mother it is not good for me to live at home it is good for me to go forth
well then dear boy kolita know that the time for such a change has come
having obtained his parents consent the young brahmin kolita slowly regained his strength vigor and determination by drinking rice gruel
he left the village of kasthavata and set out for the village of nalada
as the young brahmin upatisya enjoyed solitude he had gone to live in the forest
where he gave instruction to five hundred young brahmins in the reciting of mantras
in time the young brahmin kolita reached the village of nalada and asked upatisyas parents
father mother where is upatisya
father mother where is upatisya
they replied upatisya enjoys solitude so he has gone to live in the forest
where he instructs five hundred young brahmins in the reciting of mantras
kolita went to upatisya and said
come join me upatisya as we have faith in only what is perfect we shall go forth from home into the homelessness
did your parents give their consent
they did
young brahmin please stay until i have asked my parents
upatisya went to his parents and said
young brahmin i will see that they give their consent right away and return
upatisya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent how long will it be until you have consent
father mother please listen
as i have faith in only what is perfect i shall go forth from home into homelessness
son is it good for you to go forth
father mother it is good for me to go forth
then go forth son
upatisya went to kolita and said
come kolita as we have faith in only what is perfect we shall go forth from home into homelessness
while i was hindered by light bindings powerless weak and perishable
you were hindered by heavy bindings tight secure and imperishable
upatisya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent how did you get the consent of yours so quickly
the venerable sariputra had gone forth in five hundred previous lives because he had made this prayer
may i be born not in a wealthy house nor in one that is poor let it be rather in a house of moderate means and always among many renunciants
kolita said to upatisya
young brahmin as we are wellknown brahmins we cannot join just any renunciant order
meanwhile there were six tirthika teachers living in rajagrha who entertained the conceit of omniscience although they were not omniscient
we must properly scrutinize the different renunciant orders and only then join one with that they made their way to rajagrha
purana kasyapa gosaliputra the wanderer sanjayin son of vairatti ajita of the hair shawl
kakuda a descendant of katyayana and jnatiputra the nirgrantha
the young brahmins upatisya and kolita went to purana kasyapa and asked him
sir what is your approach to the dharma
what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living a holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied purana this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
there is nothing to alms oblations ritual sacrifices good deeds or bad deeds
there are no results or fruitions from performing good deeds or bad deeds
there is no present life there is no afterlife
there is no mother there is no father
sentient beings are not born miraculously
in the world there are no arhats who have reached perfection who have entered perfection
who can knowingly say that through their heightened insight they have seen this and future lives and proclaim we have overcome birth
we have lived the holy life we have done what needed to be done
we will know no life other than this
ones lifeforce persists for the duration of this life but is annihilated after that
it will perish and after death will not arise again
a persons body is forged from the four great elements
for once its time is up the bodys solid structures recede into earth
the bodys fluids recede into water the bodys heat recedes into fire and the bodys vital energies recede into wind
the senses fade into space
a persons corpse is borne on a bier carried by four men and taken to the charnel ground where it is burned never to be seen again
what burns turns to ash the bones turn a pigeonlike grey
those who are confused about these things counsel giving while the wise counsel taking
those who argue that such things exist are all vainly debating what is empty and hollow
both the childish and the wise will cease to be
the young brahmins upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher has strayed onto a spurious path
he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected
knowing this they spoke in verse he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
puranas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to gosaliputra the wanderer and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied the wanderer this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
that sentient beings are afflicted has nothing to do with causes and conditions
the affliction of sentient beings has nothing to do with causes and conditions
that sentient beings are purified has nothing to do with causes and conditions
the purification of sentient beings occurs randomly and by chance
that sentient beings lack understanding and insight has nothing to do with causes and conditions
their lack of understanding and insight occurs randomly and by chance
that sentient beings acquire understanding and insight has nothing to do with causes and conditions
their acquisition of understanding and insight occurs randomly and by chance
it is not due to vigor it is not due to determination it is not due to a combination of vigor and determination
it is not due to a persons skill it is not due to his overpowering ability
all beings all living things and all elements are powerless
it is not due to ones own skill it is not due to anothers skill
it is not due to a combination of ones own skill and anothers skill
it is not due to a combination of a persons skill and overpowering ability
they lack strength influence determination and the ability to overcome
a beings life is predetermined
that is why we experience the unique pleasures and pains of each of the six realms
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path
he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected
knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
gosaliputras teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to sanjayin son of vairatti and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied sanjayin this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
a person may act or make another person act
maim or make another person maim
burn or make another person burn flog or make another person flog
endanger life take what has not been given
engage wrongfully in acts of desire knowingly speak falsehoods
imbibe intoxicating drinks break into a house
pick a lock rob at knifepoint
block a road and lie in wait sack a town
sack a city sack a region
or slaughter dismember flog and tear apart every last being on this earth with the edge of a cakra blade
and having done all those things there would be no sin in that nor would any sin come from it
and then having cut up dismembered flogged and torn apart all beings
lay all the flesh out on a single plane in a single mound in a single pile or a single heap
n having laid all the flesh out on a single plane in a single mound in a single pile or a single heap
one could walk along the south bank of the river ganga and slaughter
dismember flog and tear apart everything
or walk along the north bank of the river ganga and give alms and oblations
and there would be no sin or merit in either
nor would sin or merit come from either
even if one practices generosity discipline perfect restraint
and acts with purpose and integrity one still does not gain merit
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
sanjayins teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to ajita of the hair shawl and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied ajita this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
seven bodies are not products they are not byproducts they are not apparitions they are not byproducts of apparitions
they are not subject to harm they are everlasting and they are still and solid like a pillar
what are the seven
the seven are thus the body of earth the body of water the body of fire the body of wind pleasure pain and the vitality of life
those seven bodies are not products are not byproducts
are not apparitions are not byproducts of apparitions are not subject to harm
are everlasting and are still and solid like a pillar
nor do they become merit nor do they become sin nor do they become both merit and sin
those seven are such
that they do not waver
nor do they become pleasure nor do they become pain nor do they become both pleasure and pain
they do not change nor do they harm one another
were one person to cut off the head of another person even that would not influence the world
nor would it cause the slightest harm to that which is still and solid
for the weapon would pass straight through the unbroken spaces in those seven bodies leaving the life within them unharmed
no rousing them no making to rouse them
no awareness of them no making to be aware of them
no knowing them and no making them known
sixtytwo paths sixtytwo intermediate eons
two types of actions action halfactions
five types of actions three types of actions
there is absolutely no killing them no making to kill them
in the meantime you are reborn in and cycle through principal places of rebirth great eons
thirtysix hells one hundred and twenty senses
sixtytwo constituent particles classes of naga families
classes of garuda classes of wanderers
classes of garuda classes of wanderers
classes of ajivika classes of nirgrantha
seven realms with discerning awareness seven realms lacking discerning awareness
seven nirgrantha realms seven demigod realms seven demonic realms
seven godly realms seven human realms seven great oceans
seven hundred lakes seven great dreams seven hundred dreams
seven states of great diminishment seven hundred states of diminishment
seven states of great increase seven hundred states of increase
seven states of great depletion seven hundred states of depletion
seven great abysses seven hundred abysses
six noble clans ten highstatus rebirths and the eight grounds of a great person
thus just as a ball of thread thrown in the air unravels into a long thread as it falls everyone be they childish or wise is liberated from suffering after having been through the cycle of rebirth for eons
no ascetic or brahmin can say
by observing ethics a vow asceticism or celibacy
i shall bring to fruition those acts that have not borne fruit and in facing those acts that have borne fruit purify them
our pleasures and pains are predestined it is impossible to extend or reduce them
as this is how things are and not otherwise the rounds of existence are thus to be counted
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied kakuda katyayana this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
if someone comes to me and asks is there an afterlife
i answer him by saying there is an afterlife
if he should ask is there not an afterlife
i answer him by saying there is no afterlife
if he should ask is there or is there not an afterlife
i answer him by saying there is and is not an afterlife
if he should ask does an afterlife neither exist nor not exist
i answer him by saying an afterlife neither exists nor does it not exist
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
ajitas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to kakuda katyayana and asked
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
likewise if someone comes to me and asks is the afterlife like or unlike this world
i answer him by saying the afterlife is like and unlike this world
if he should ask is the afterlife different or not different
i answer by saying the afterlife is different and not different if he should ask is the afterlife not different or not not different
if he should ask is the afterlife not different or not not different
i answer him by saying the afterlife is not different and not not different
if he should ask is the afterlife like that or not like that
i answer him by saying the afterlife is like that and not like that
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
kakuda katyayanas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to jnatiputra the nirgrantha and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied the nirgrantha this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
no matter what a person individually experiences it all comes from causes sown in the past
old actions are purified through penance while new actions are averted by the dam of inactivity
in this way one avoids future defilement in the absence of defilement actions are exhausted
when actions are exhausted suffering is exhausted
when suffering is exhausted one is freed from suffering
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
the nirgranthas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
not long before word had spread about a tirthika named sanjayin
the young brahmins upatisya and kolita went to where the teacher sanjayin lived and asked
gentlemen where is the teacher sanjayin
he has withdrawn into seclusion
oh this is the first time weve heard the phrase withdrawn into seclusion in such a long time
they thought
it would not be right to disturb the teachers withdrawal into seclusion
we will approach him once he has risen from this state and with that they sat off to one side
the teacher sanjayin emerged from seclusion the states of absorption he had experienced had invigorated his senses
whoever has such a face must have qualities to match they approached him and asked
sir sanjayin what is your approach to the dharma
what instructions do you give to your students what is the result of living the holy life
what are its benefits sanjayin replied
young brahmins this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
the dharma is truth and nonviolence the peaceful ageless immortal and unwaning state is brahman
the two replied master what is the meaning of what you have said
as for truth renunciation is born of true thoughts
as for nonviolence all dharmas spring from the ground of nonviolence
the peaceful ageless immortal and unwaning state are other names by which nirvana may be known
that state is called brahma for if some were to achieve nirvana in this very life all would be well
but even if they did not achieve it they would still draw near to the world of brahma
even so brahmins will be reborn in the world of brahma
will alight into the world of brahma will have alighted into the world of brahma
gaining the fortune for the world of brahma is akin to entering nirvana
and how is the world of brahma
master allow us to go forth we pledge to live the holy life under your guidance
and with that the two became renunciants in sanjayins order
after the teacher sanjayin allowed upatisya and kolitas going forth
the news of their acceptance spread everywhere and sanjayin was lauded with many accolades and much praise
he thought
if i was a member of the sandilya clan before and am still a member now what has caused such abundant accolades and praise to come to me now
sanjayin thought it is not due to my own sway
rather it is the sway of these two young brahmins
thus when he accepted five hundred young brahmins for instruction in how to recite brahminic mantras he assigned two hundred and fifty to upatisya and two hundred and fifty to kolita
at one point after the teacher sanjayin had fallen ill upatisya asked kolita
kolita will you attend the master or will you seek out medicine for him
kolita thought
upatisya is intelligent i would have him attend the master while i go in search of medicine and said
please attend the master and i will seek medicine
upatisya began to attend the master and kolita went off in search of medicine
though upatisya ministered to the master with medicinal roots stalks leaves flowers and fruit the illness would not subside
though weak the master smiled prompting upatisya to ask
master given that great people like you do not smile for no reason
what causes you to smile what prompts it
upatisya replied sanjayin
allow me to explain great beings like me do not smile without cause or condition
i was thinking about the wife of king suvarnapati of suvarnadvipa when her husbands time had come she leapt onto his funeral pyre
i was thinking how the impulse to desire the very things desired and the pursuit of desire are what cause these sentient beings to suffer
when was this master at such and such a time a long time ago
in what month in such and such a month long ago
on what day on such and such a day long ago
sanjayin recorded this conversation on a board and set it down
master upatisya urged if the whole of what little renunciation we have is for ambrosia and the search for ambrosia
and if you master have found some small measure of that ambrosia
then please share it with us
son the whole of what little renunciation i have is for ambrosia and the search for ambrosia but neither have i discovered even a small measure of that ambrosia
allow me to explain on the fifteenth a day of fast i heard the gods who were passing through the heavens above say
at the foot of the snow mountains on the banks of the river bhagirathi not far from the sage kapilas hermitage a youth from the sakya clan has appeared
brahmins skilled in interpreting omens and signs made this prophecy
the youth installed in the palace will either become king of the world with his reign extending over the four directions
or he will become a king of dharma he will be endowed with the dharma or the seven precious emblems
the seven precious emblems he will possess are as follows
a precious wheel a precious elephant a precious horse
a precious jewel a precious woman a precious steward and a precious general
he will have a full one thousand sons heroic brave and of ideal build who will destroy enemy forces
but if he with perfect faith should cut his hair shave his beard don the saffron robes and go forth from home into homelessness
then he shall become a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha famed all over the world
where rule is impartial and in harmony with the dharma
under him the whole earth from sea to sea will be free from the threat of harm and violence and will be a realm without punishment or armed expulsion
you two should go forth into his teachings
having gone forth you should not proclaim your caste you should not proclaim your clan you should not proclaim your being a brahmin youth
once you have overcome conceit and pride you should live the holy life under his guidance and then you will receive a great ambrosia
then he said all accumulation ends in depletion
the lofty in the end will fall all meetings end in separation all life ends in death
on saying that he went the way of all temporal phenomena
after decorating the sides of his bier with blue yellow red and white cloth they carried his corpse to the charnel ground and cremated him
in time their grief subsided
n time a young brahmin named suvarnajata from suvarnadvipa arrived in rajagrha
when he entered their dwelling upatisya asked
young brahmin where have you come from
from suvarnadvipa he replied
young brahmin did you see anything at all amazing or remarkable in suvarnadvipa
i didnt see anything truly amazing or remarkable he replied
but i did see something somewhat amazing and remarkable so listen as you please
the wife of king suvarnapati of suvarnadvipa leapt onto his funeral pyre when her husbands time had come
when was this at such and such a time a long time ago
in what month in such and such a month long ago
on what day on such and such a day long ago
when upatisya looked at the conversation recorded on the board he saw that everything was exactly as sanjayin had said
at which point he said to kolita our master sanjayin concealed his learning from us
if he had found such rare ambrosia he did not share it with us
for if he himself saw forms in other lands with the divine eye and heard pleasant sounds with the divine ear
then his claim to have found no ambrosia is not true
kolita thought
upatisya is intelligent were he to find such ambrosia he may not tell me and a situation such as this might happen again
then he said upatisya join me in a pledge
whoever finds such ambrosia first he shall share it with the other
they made the pledge and set out on their journey going forth
when the blessed bodhisattva reached the age of twentynine he ceased to revel in desires for the sight of the elderly the sick and the dead had moved him deeply
he stole out in the middle of the night and fled into the forest
where he spent six years practicing austerities
but he came to see that those austerities would amount to nothing
he then breathed freely in and out and partook again of solid foods such as rice and porridge
he rubbed ghee and oil into his skin and took refreshing baths in warm water
when he came to the village of senani the village headmans daughters nanda and nandabala
gave him milk that had been churned sixteen times and mixed with honey to drink
he was lauded by the naga king kalika and he accepted a bundle of auspicious goldencolored kusa grass from a grassmonger
from there he went to what would be the site of his awakening
he arrived and settled crosslegged into an unshakable absorption on an unshakable bed of kusa grass
sitting straight and erect he settled his mind and said
i shall not uncross my legs until i have achieved the undefiled state
his intention pledged he said so long as i have not found an undefiled state i shall not uncross my legs
during the midnight hours through the power of his loving kindness the blessed one subdued mara and his retinue of million demonic spirits
and unsurpassed wisdom arose within him at brahmas request he went to varanasi
and turned the wheel of dharma revealing in three phases a teaching with twelve aspects
during that time he converted the group of five the five friends and fifty highborn village brahmin youths
who then went forth and received full ordination
while passing through the karpasi forest he convinced a noble band of sixty youths of the truths
while passing through the village of senani
he convinced the village headmans daughters nanda and nandabala of the truths
while passing through uruvilva
he inspired a group of one thousand dreadlocked ascetics to go forth and ordained them
while passing by the gayasirsa stupa he instructed those one thousand monks by displaying three miracles
thereby freeing them from the wilds of samsara and establishing them in the utterly final state of perfection and the unsurpassably blissful state of nirvana
while passing through the yasti forest
he brought the king of magadha bimbisara of the guilds to the truths along with gods and many hundreds of thousands of magadhan brahmins and householders
while passing through rajagrha he accepted the offering of a bamboo grove
it was then that the blessed buddha took up residence at the kalandakanivasa in rajagrhas bamboo grove
on their journeys and travels upatisya and kolita also arrived in rajagrha
they saw that rajagrha was utterly still and thought
one of only two things could have brought utter quiet to this town
either fear of neighboring armies or the presence of several ascetics and brahmins famed for their merit and majesty
as they began to examine the stars they acknowledged
as neighboring armies present no imminent danger tomorrow we shall know more
the two were in the habit of daubing three lines of ash across their foreheads and going out on their daily rounds
when they did so many hundreds of thousands of creatures would always follow after them
the next day they daubed three lines of ash across their foreheads and went out on their daily rounds
however on that day not a single being followed after them
on returning they considered the matter
they saw that not a single being had followed after them and wondered
in the past when we have gone out on rounds many hundreds of thousands of creatures would follow after us
why then has not a single being followed after us today
there is nothing even in the slightest the blessed buddhas do not know
do not see are not aware of or do not notice
thus the blessed buddha subsists alive and well endowed with great compassion
engaged in actions to help the world
is its sole protector its lone champion one of a kind
does not speak duplicitously is sustained by calm abiding and insight illuminates the three types of knowledge
is welltrained in the three trainings is skilled in the three approaches to discipline
has crossed the four rivers is wellgrounded in his use of the four foundations of miraculous conduct
and is one who long ago perfected the four means of attraction
who teaches the four noble truths who being fearless in four ways is never frightened who has abandoned the five branches
has transcended the five rebirths teaches the five aggregates to be selfless
is in possession of the six branches and has perfected the six perfections
who always abides by the six spheres who binds the six sense gates
who accustoms himself to the six dharmas that elicit perfect joy
who is rich with the flower of awakenings seven branches who displays the seven treasures of a noble being
who is unstained by the eight mundane concerns who knows the nine things that inspire aggression
who teaches the eight branches of the path who is skilled in the nine stages of meditative absorption
who possesses the strength of the ten strengths whose good name has spread in the ten directions
and who surpasses those who rule over the thousandfold universe
as it is in the nature of such beings to watch over the world with their buddha eye during the three times of the day and night
they know and see who has fallen who has flourished who hurts
who wants who is unhappy who hurts
who wants who is unhappy who is headed for a miserable rebirth
who will fall into a miserable rebirth who will decide to rise from his path towards a miserable rebirth and land in a highstatus rebirth
liberation or the fruition
who will reach out his hand to those sinking in the mud of desire
who lacks the riches of a noble beings treasures who will come to the magnificent wealth of a noble beings treasures
whose buddhahood with its attendant fruits will ornament the world
whose latent roots of virtue will bud
whose budding roots of virtue will blossom
and who having blossomed will be freed
it has been said the home of noxious water beasts may in time evaporate
but the love of buddhas for their disciples shall not
thus the blessed one watches over the world with his buddha eye
with this eye the blessed one saw that the minds of the wanderers upatisya and kolita had been ripened through their service to past buddhas
so its love for those who fall to the miserable realms and samsara is like the cows love for its fallen calf
an omniscient minds compassion never wanes in its quest for the young calves it nurses
tathagatas too hold dear and protect their disciples
as a mother holds dear and protects her only child
and the stores of virtue they had amassed
and the stores of virtue they had amassed
and thus he understood that the two wanderers were like fruit ripe for the plucking the time to train them had come
the blessed one thought
will these two be captivated by the teacher or by his disciples
and saw they would be captivated by disciples
thinking that he saw they would be drawn by conduct
he thought what will be their way into the renunciant order will they be drawn by miracles or by conduct
the blessed one summoned the venerable asvajit whose conduct he saw would captivate them
for conduct like his captivated gods and men
then the blessed one instructed the venerable asvajit
asvajit consider the wanderers upatisya and kolita
asvajits silence indicated his assent to the blessed ones instruction
as asvajit was fully committed to acting on the blessed ones instruction he praised and welcomed the blessed ones instruction
bowing his head at the blessed ones feet he said i go with the blessed ones guidance
early the next morning after the night had passed the venerable asvajit put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes and went to beg alms in rajagrha
as he walked he gazed just ahead he gazed to his left and right
with his arms drawn in and his legs extended dignified by his ceremonial robe dharma robes and begging bowl
meanwhile the wanderer upatisya was out and about in rajagrha on some errand when he saw from afar the venerable asvajit who had come to beg alms in rajagrha
upatisya saw him walking gazing just ahead gazing to his left and right
his arms drawn in and his legs extended dignified by his robe shawl and begging bowl
on seeing him he thought
so this is what the renunciants who come to live here in rajagrha are like
never in my life have i seen anyone carry himself like this renunciant
i must approach him and ask monk who is your teacher
knowing the monk was likely to pass by one of the main crossroads upatisya went there to wait
when the venerable asvajit reached the spot where upatisya was
upatisya asked this of asvajit
monk who is your teacher why have you gone forth whose dharma do you favor
gautama the venerable monk and prince of the sakyas left the sakya clan shaved his head and beard
donned the saffron robes and with perfect faith went forth from home into homelessness
in his unsurpassed perfect awakening he has become a perfect buddha
my teacher is the blessed one
it is because of him that i have gone forth it is his dharma that i favor
monk then you must share one of his teachings
venerable i am but young and a new renunciant so it would not be easy for me to fully and perfectly explain the teachings of the blessed one who is a tathagata an arhat a perfect buddha
thus i will share with you their import
monk the import is what i need what good is a lengthy explanation
please teach me the import whatever its length
the venerable asvajit spoke this verse
those phenomena that arise from causes the tathagata himself has taught that they have a cause and also a cessation the great sramana is the one who thus proclaims
those phenomena that arise from causes the tathagata himself has taught that they have a cause and also a cessation
the great sramana is the one who thus proclaims
once he had explained this aspect of the dharma upatisya came to see phenomena through the unclouded and pristine eyes of dharma
upatisya saw the dharma heard the dharma
knew the dharma plumbed the depths of the dharma overcame his skepticism
transcended doubt could not be swayed by others and was not reliant on others
with his newfound fearless confidence in the dharma taught by the teacher he stood up from his seat
ulled his shawl from one shoulder bowed to the venerable asvajit with his palms pressed together and spoke in verse
this is the dharma of saviors for millions upon billions of eons
i have neither seen it nor heard it may i come to realize this immortal and peaceful state
venerable where is the blessed one now
venerable at the kalandakanivapa in the bamboo grove outside rajagrha
upatisya then praised and welcomed what asvajit had said
after prostrating at asvajits feet he circumambulated him three times and went to see kolita
from a long way off kolita saw upatisya approaching
on meeting him he said to upatisya
venerable your faculties are clear and your complexion lustrous
if your skin is so radiant does that mean you have found ambrosia
i have found someone worth venerating
share this venerable ones teaching upatisya then spoke in verse
the great sramana is the one who thus proclaims
venerable please repeat it one more time venerable say it again
those phenomena that arise from causes the tathagata himself has taught that they have a cause and also a cessation
once upatisya had explained this aspect of the dharma
kolita too came to see phenomena through the unclouded and pristine eyes of dharma
kolita saw the dharma heard the dharma knew the dharma plumbed the depths of the dharma
overcame his skepticism transcended doubt
could not be swayed by others and could not be led astray by others
having gained a fearless confidence in the dharma taught by the teacher
he stood up from his seat pulled his shawl from one shoulder bowed to upatisya with his palms pressed together
nd spoke in verse
this is the dharma of saviors for millions upon billions of eons
i have neither seen it nor heard it may i come to realize this immortal and peaceful state
venerable where is the blessed one now
at the kalandakanivapa in the bamboo grove outside rajagrha
come we must live the holy life under the guidance of the blessed one
but venerable we must first see our followers
for it is only proper that knowledgeable and prominent people like us visit our followers
so the wanderers upatisya and kolita went to the young brahmins and said
young brahmins listen
what will you do if we two go to live the holy life under the guidance of the blessed one
masters the little we seek we seek because of you
so if you two masters go to live the holy life under the guidance of the blessed one and go forth we too will go forth
young brahmins then know that the time has come
upatisya and kolita and their students apiece then went to the kalandakanivapa in the bamboo grove
at the time the venerable asvajit was seated taking shelter from the sun at the foot of a tree
the wanderers upatisya and kolita saw the venerable asvajit from a long way off
on seeing him upatisya asked kolita
kolita do we first pay our respects to the blessed one or to the one from whom we have heard of his dharma
to the one from whom we have heard of his dharma
the two of them went to the venerable asvajit reaching him they prostrated at his feet before taking a seat off to one side
like a pure brahmin does to fire bow with respect to the one whether he be young or old who tells you of the dharma
at that point a brahmin who loved fire paid it homage and respect
he then spoke a verse of the blessed ones
when upatisya and kolita had prostrated at the feet of asvajit they left and went to where the blessed one was
at the time the blessed one was seated teaching dharma to a crowd of many hundreds of monk followers
the blessed one saw upatisya and kolita from a long way off
when he saw them he said to the monks
monks embrace your friends bring them to the head of the assembly let them come before you
do you see upatisya and kolita or do you see venerable ones
these two will become my disciples my foremost and noblest pair
for one shall become the greatest of miracle workers and the other shall become the wisest of the wise
a monk then spoke a verse
to what the teacher knows there is no end his mind the perfection of human capacity
the blessed one has reached samsaras end
so before our friends upatisya and kolita arrived in the bamboo grove he foresaw their coming and said with certainty among this gathering
one will be the greatest of miracle workers the other will be the wisest of the wise
these two will become the foremost among all my disciples
upatisya and kolita then approached the blessed one
prostrated at his feet and made the following request
if we are permitted reverend we would obtain the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
we would live the holy life in the blessed ones presence
with but a weeks worth of hair and beard
only after the blessed one had given his consent did their hair fall out and they were clothed in robes
the blessed one said to them come join me thereby allowing their going forth
he enjoined them with the words monks come join me and live the holy life
again it is said hair tonsured and body clad in robes from the tathagatas call to come forth that moment their senses were perfectly stilled
having completed their approach to monkhood they stood with the deportment of monks who had been ordained for one hundred years
with but a weeks worth of hair and beard alms bowl and water pitcher in their hands
for then will your body be swathed in the buddhas mind
and entered rajagrha to beg for alms
early the next morning a great many monks put on their lower robes took up their begging bowls and dharma robes
the buddha has come to rajagrha magadhas premier city
vilifying the monks they spoke in verse
and joined the buddhas renunciant order they quickly became disappointed and visibly upset
and led away all sanjayins students only when there was naught else to lead away
the monks were crestfallen upset and lost their fearlessness
washed their feet and went hurting and upset to see the blessed one
having gone to collect alms in rajagrha the great many monks ate what they had been given and
as alms are not sought after noon packed their begging bowls and dharma robes
as they arrived the great many monks prostrated at the blessed ones feet
sat off to one side and told the blessed one
reverend early this morning a great many of us monks put on our robes
picked up our begging bowls and dharma robes and went to rajagrha to collect alms
there when the people of rajagrha saw that members of sanjayins tirthika community had renounced it
vilifying us they spoke in verse
vilifying us they spoke in verse
the buddha has come to rajagrha magadhas premier city and and led away all sanjayins students only when there was naught else to lead away
with this we became crestfallen upset and lost our fearlessness
monks instructed the blessed one say this to the people of rajagrha who say such things
here the mighty sugatas lead with the sublime dharma
what wise man could reject such noble leadership
that will dispel all the vanity and selfassurance of the people of rajagrha who speak like that
early the next morning a great many monks put on their robes took up their begging bowls and dharma robes
and entered rajagrha to beg for alms
when the people of rajagrha saw that members of sanjayins tirthika community had renounced it and joined the buddhas renunciant order they soon become disappointed and visibly upset
vilifying the monks they again spoke the same verse
one monk then replied
here the mighty sugatas lead with the sublime dharma
what wise man could reject such noble leadership
with that statement he dispelled all the vanity and selfassurance of the people of rajagrha who spoke like that
some time later the brahmin matharas time came as did his wifes
the brahmin tisyas time came as did sarikas
tisyas son kosthila returned to the village of nalada from the south where he had taken up with the lokayata ascetics
the village gatekeeper recognized him and asked
sir are you kosthila people know me thus
what has become of the brahmin mathara his time came
what has become of his wife her time came
what has become of the brahmin tisya his time came too
what has become of sarika her time came too
what has become of sariputra shortly after a teacher named sanjayin appeared in rajagrha he went forth and joined his renunciant order
lately it has become common for brahmins to go forth
kosthila then made his way to rajagrha and when he arrived there he asked
what has become of the teacher sanjayin his time came
what has become of his tirthika community
they have all gone forth and joined the renunciant order around the ascetic gautama
it would have been good had the ascetic gautama who was prophesied to become king of the world become royal priest
as he sat there off to one side dirghanakha said to the blessed one
o gautama no self endures
son of a selfimmolator even that view you hold which views all forms of self as unable to endure does not itself endure
agreed o gautama replied dirghanakha even that view which views all forms of self as unable to endure does not itself endure
if you see it like that that view too will be abandoned discarded and cease to be
son of a selfimmolator then know this
other views too will not be entertained embraced or arise
o gautama i know this
the blessed one replied at length son of a selfimmolator you are like and akin to most people
kosthila who had taken the name dirghanakha when he became a wanderer went to see the blessed one
when he arrived he and the blessed one were clearly overjoyed to see one another and exchanged warm words of goodwill before dirghanakha sat off to one side
for most people also view things thus and say such things and in that you are just like them
son of a selfimmolator in this world those ascetics and brahmins who discard this view
and those ascetics and brahmins who do not embrace other views are said to be the fewest of the few
son of a selfimmolator there are three positions regarding the view what are those three positions
son of a selfimmolator regarding this point some hold the view and argue that all selves endure
others hold the view and argue that no self endures
while still others hold the view and argue that some selves endure and other selves do not endure
son of a selfimmolator in holding that all selves endure attachment will arise
and attachment will not disappear aversion will arise and aversion will not disappear
confusion will arise and confusion will not disappear
accumulation will occur and accumulation will not disappear
fetters will occur and fetters will not disappear
and defilement will arise and purification will not occur
with this view that holds that all selves endure eager anticipation pursuit and excessive attachment will arise
and purification will occur and defilement will disappear
one will be free of fetters and fetters will not occur
accumulation will disappear and accumulation will not occur
confusion will disappear and confusion will not arise
aversion will disappear and aversion will not arise
son of a selfimmolator in holding that no self endures
attachment will disappear and attachment will not arise
with this view that holds that no self endures there will be no eager anticipation
no pursuit and excessive attachment will disappear
son of a selfimmolator regarding the view that some selves endure and other selves do not endure
in holding that some selves do endure attachment will arise and attachment will not disappear
aversion will arise and aversion will not disappear
confusion will arise and confusion will not disappear
accumulation will occur and accumulation will not disappear
fetters will occur and fetters will not disappear
and defilement will arise and purification will not occur
with this view that holds that some selves endure eager anticipation
pursuit and excessive attachment will arise
at the same time in holding that some selves do not endure attachment will disappear and attachment will not arise
aversion will disappear and aversion will not arise
confusion will disappear and confusion will not arise
accumulation will disappear and accumulation will not occur
one will be free of fetters and fetters will not occur
and purification will occur and defilement will disappear
with this view that holds that some selves do not endure there will be no eager anticipation
informed noble disciples scrutinize the first position in this way
if one holds the view and argues that all selves endure then the view and argument that no self endures
and the view and argument that some selves endure while other selves do not endure would counter and undermine the self
if it counters it would undermine and if it undermines it would debunk the self
in correctly seeing the countering the undermining and the debunking thus done
that view too would be abandoned and other views would not be embraced
thus that view of self too would be abandoned discarded and cease to be
while other views too would not be entertained embraced or arise
informed noble disciples scrutinize the second position in this way
if one holds the view and argues that no self endures then the view and argument that all selves endure
informed noble disciples scrutinize the third position in this way
the view and argument that all selves endure and the view and argument that no selves endure would counter and undermine the self
if one holds the view and argues that some selves endure while other selves do not endure
while other views too would not be entertained embraced or arise
son of a selfimmolator as this body is composed of gross form and arises from the four great elements
noble disciples observe and dwell on its repeated arising and destruction
if noble disciples observe and dwell on its repeated arising and destruction
whatever aspirations attachment craving obsessions
preoccupations or excessive attachment may arise towards the body will be confronted and will not remain
son of a selfimmolator there are three feelings what are these three
pleasure pain and that which is neither pleasant nor painful
son of a selfimmolator when noble disciples experience feelings of pleasure
then feelings of pain and feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful come to a halt
at that time noble disciples experience only feelings of pleasure
yet feelings of pleasure too are subject to impermanence suffering and cessation
when noble disciples experience feelings of pain
then feelings of pleasure and feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful come to a halt
at that time noble disciples experience only feelings of pain
yet feelings of pain too are subject to impermanence suffering and cessation
when noble disciples experience feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful then feelings of pleasure and pain come to a halt
at that time noble disciples experience only feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful
yet feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful too are subject to impermanence suffering and cessation
thus they think what is the basis for these feelings
what are their origins what types of things are compatible with them
what has produced their arising
on reflection the basis for these feelings is contact
their origins lie in contact they are compatible with contact what has produced them is contact
thus contact of different types occurs prompting feelings of different types to arise
contact of different types cease prompting feelings of different types to cease
to calm to cool off to fade away
thus when they experience feelings that are pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful
they thoroughly and precisely understand their origins their fading their flavor their shortcomings and their perfect renunciation
and viewing and resting in its utter abandonment they are not taken in even in the slightest by the world
viewing it free of desirous attachment viewing its cessation
when they view and rest in the impermanence of any feeling that arises while viewing its dwindling viewing its disintegration
they view it free of desirous attachment they view its cessation and view and rest in its utter abandonment
they view its dwindling they view its disintegration
they view and rest in the impermanence of any feeling that arises
when they thoroughly and precisely understand their origins their fading their flavor their shortcomings and their perfect renunciation
if they are not taken in there will be no torment
if there is no torment they will understand that their births have come to an end
that they have lived the holy life that they have done what needed doing
and that they will know no lives after this one
and that they will know no lives after this one thus they themselves will altogether transcend misery
when they experience the bodys most basic feelings
they thoroughly and precisely understand them with the thought i am experiencing the bodys most basic feelings
when they experience the lifeforces most basic feeling
they thoroughly and precisely understand it with the thought i am experiencing the lifeforces most basic feeling
since the lifeforce comes to an end after the body has perished
all of that lifes feelings every last one of them come to a halt
every last one of them fades away every last one of them dwindles away
and every last one of them comes to an end
thus they think when i experience feelings of pleasure if the body should perish that will be the end of suffering
when i experience feelings of pain and feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful
if the body should perish that will be the end of suffering
thus when they experience the feeling of pleasure it is unaccompanied it is not accompanied by experiences
when they experience the feeling of pain or a feeling that is neither pleasant nor painful it is unaccompanied it is not accompanied by experiences
what does not accompany their death it is not accompanied by desire aversion or confusion
it is not accompanied by birth aging illness death mourning cries of misery
pain unease or disturbance
it is not i argue accompanied by suffering
during this talk the venerable sariputra who had been ordained two weeks earlier
sat fanning the blessed one
sariputra then had this thought
the blessed one has praised the abandonment of such phenomena along with the freedom from the cessation of and the utter abandonment of desire
i too should observe and abide by the abandonment of such phenomena
and should observe freedom from desire
sariputra then observed and abided by the abandonment of such phenomena
i too should observe and abide by the abandonment of such phenomena and should observe freedom from desire
i too should observe and abide by the abandonment of such phenomena and its cessation i too should observe and abide by its utter abandonment
he proceeded to observe freedom from desire observe its cessation and observe and abide by its utter abandonment
for then will your body be swathed in the buddhas mind
though your head be tonsured and your body clad in robes it is more important that your senses be stilled
again it is said once called by the tathagata to come forth
he stood with the deportment of a monk who had been ordained for one hundred years
heard the dharma knew the dharma plumbed the depths of the dharma
overcame his skepticism transcended doubt
could not be swayed by others and could not be led astray by others
with his newfound fearless confidence in the dharma taught by the teacher he stood up from his seat
pulled his shawl from one shoulder bowed to the blessed one with his palms pressed together
and made the following request to the blessed one
if it is permitted reverend i would obtain the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
i would live the holy life in the blessed ones presence
dirghanakha saw the dharma
the wanderer dirghanakha too came to see phenomena through the unclouded and pristine eyes of dharma
and observe and abide by its utter abandonment his mind in the absence of grasping was freed from defilements
as he observed and abided by the abandonment of such phenomena and proceeded to observe freedom from desire observe its cessation
only after the blessed one had given his consent did his hair fall out and was he clothed in robes
with but a weeks worth of hair and beard alms bowl and water pitcher in hand having completed his approach to monkhood
the blessed one said to him come join me thereby allowing his going forth
and enjoined him with the words monk come join me and live the holy life
with this going forth dirghanakha went to live alone in solitude diligent and persevering devoted to his resolve
while living alone in solitude diligent and persevering devoted to his resolve
he perceived that he had in that very life actualized the unsurpassed aim of the holy life for which the sons of noble families
a section index
thus the venerable one achieved the allknowing state of an arhat whose mind had been utterly freed
i have done what needed doing i will know no lives after this one
with his achievement he understood my births have come to an end i have lived the holy life
with perfect faith cut their hair shave their beards don the saffron robes and go forth from home into homelessness
all selves do not endure you who view things thus
you are just like them worldly persons ascetics and brahmins
and their three positions on the view informed noble disciples
body feelings and the cessation of the basis for feelings understanding their origin and the like
transcending misery the most basic of body and lifeforce life ends unaccompanied
with the perishing of the body and the end of suffering and lastly sariputra
the blessed one said to the monks
monks among my monk disciples who have gained the knowledge of perfect discernment
the monk kosthila is supreme
in doubt the monks went to him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha and asked
reverend what is it that the venerable sariputra has done
that the ripened fruit of that action has made his intellect sharper finer and more incisive
monks replied the blessed one
sariputra himself discovered the store of action mastered conditions
tended to them as one does an irrigation channel and emerged without indecision
as he himself acted and accumulated thus no one else experiences the results of actions and accumulations as sariputra has done
monks actions and accumulations do not ripen upon the outer elements
they do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
the virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated
come to fruition upon the aggregates elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons when the time and the conditions are right they alight upon embodied beings
monks long ago a brahmin who lived in a remote mountain range took a wife of equal caste and together they sported made love and indulged all their desires
from their sporting lovemaking and the indulging all of their desires there came a boy whom they named surpi
again they sported made love and indulged all their desires producing a girl whom they named suksma
after a while their brahmin fathers time came as did his wifes
the young brahmin surpi because he loved solitude took his sister to live in a remote forest
at a certain point his sister suksma grew into a woman and at the time beset by disturbing emotions said
brother i cannot be sustained by the medicinal plants in this forest let us go to the outskirts of town
so surpi took his sister to the outskirts of town and as they approached a house to beg alms
a brahmin sitting in his home heard the voice of a man speaking to a woman
on hearing this the brahmin came out and asked
what is a sage doing traveling with a wife
this is not my wife this is my younger sister
would you give us a little something to eat
i will not and if i refuse would you give me your sister
that would be a sin and i reject such ignoble principles
suksma said brother the medicinal plants in this forest do not sustain me so it was i who suggested we go to the edge of town
why did i suggest it incapacitated as i am by emotions i trusted you would know what to do
why did i suggest it incapacitated as i am by emotions i trusted you would know what to do
i will give a large dowry and take her as my bride said the brahmin
brother let us leave said suksma and together they stepped away
surpi said it is because i do not pursue desires that i have gone to remote places
then brother should you attain even the slightest store of qualities you must come share them with me
surpi went off into the wilds and without a teacher or a guide
gave rise to the thirtyseven qualities conducive to awakening and actualized his own awakening
he then thought
i promised to share any such attainment with my sister so i must do so
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
so out of the great love and compassion surpi felt like a swan spreading its wings
he flew up into the sky above and began to miraculously invoke flashes and bursts of light clouds and lightning
now because ordinary beings are swift to pay heed to miracles
suksma dropped like a felled tree at the pratyekabuddhas feet and said
noble one have you found such a store of qualities i have
noble one accept these alms
i seek merit so please stay here and let me provide you all the provisions you need
sister first ask the master of the house she went to the brahmin the master of the house and said
son of a lord my brother has gone forth accomplished his vow and become a great being
please allow him to stay and i will offer him all the provisions he needs
her husband replied if i give to laymen without being asked
why would i not give to a renunciant who has lived up to his vows and become a saint
go do as you please and offer him all the provisions he needs
after three months during which she offered the pratyekabuddha all the provisions he needed
she offered him a piece of cotton cloth large enough to be worn as a robe a needle a razor and thread
he accepted the cotton cloth needle razor and thread and began to cut the cloth in front of her
as he sharpened the razors blade
suksma prostrated at his feet and said this prayer
just as this razors blade becomes sharper and sharper
may these roots of virtue sharpen my intellect
the pratyekabuddha began to poke holes with the needle and as the needle made finer and finer holes
just as this needle pokes finer and finer holes
may these roots of virtue refine my intellect
the pratyekabuddha began to sew with the thread and as the thread passed through the cloth unhindered
may these roots of virtue help me develop an incisive intellect
just as this thread passes unhindered through cloth
monks at that time the monk sariputra was the brahmins daughter suksma
that action of making offerings and prayers to the pratyekabuddha ripened so that now his intellect is sharp fine and incisive
monks the ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negative
but the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive
and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixed
monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions
and seek wholly positive actions monks this is how you should train
still in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
reverend what has the venerable sariputra done that the ripened fruit of his action has led to his birth into a family that is neither extremely rich nor extremely poor
but into a family of moderate means with many renunciants
the blessed one replied
monks sariputra himself discovered the store of action mastered conditions
and so no one else experiences sariputras actions and accumulations for themselves
tended to them as one does an irrigation channel and emerged without indecision he himself acted and accumulated this store
monks actions and accumulations do not ripen upon the external elements
they do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated come to ripen upon the aggregates
elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons
when the time and the conditions are right they alight upon embodied beings
monks long ago a king who lived in a remote mountain range took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all of their desires
from their sporting lovemaking and the indulging all of their desires
there came a boy whom they nurtured and raised until he grew into a man
seeing that his father ruled in ways compatible with the principles of justice the boy thought
when my father passes i will become king
if i exercise my royal authority in ways compatible with the principles of justice in a later life i will go to hell
he went to the king and said
father grant me leave i wish to go forth in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
the king replied
son the royal authority for which you have made offerings to the gods performed fire puja and suffered through austerities is within reach
having been born into a caste borne about by elephants why would you renounce itand with that his father refused to let him go forth
some time later the boy set out riding astride the neck of an elephant
when he saw a poor man on his begging rounds holding a staff and a broken beggars bowl
the prince went to him and said
householder because i was born into a wealthy family i could not get consent to go forth
you are poor so why have you not joined such an order
prince he replied how could i go forth if i dont have a begging bowl or a dharma robe
good man come said the prince i will give you a begging bowl and a dharma robe
the prince then took him to the sanctuary of a sage endowed with the five types of heightened awareness
the prince got down from his perch atop the elephants neck and said calmly
sir this noble son wishes to go forth
allow him to do so and i shall provide his begging bowl and dharma robe
so the sage allowed the beggar to go forth
the prince then washed a begging bowl and had a dharma robe cut sewn and dyed
he handed them over to the former beggar and said
noble one should you attain even the slightest store of qualities you must tell me
he promised the prince he would do so and went off into the wilds
without a teacher or a guide he gave rise to the thirtyseven qualities conducive to awakening and actualized his own awakening
he then thought
this small store of qualities i have attained i have attained with the help of the prince
i promised to share any such attainment with him so i must do so
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
so out of the great love and compassion he felt like a swan spreading its wings he flew up into the sky above
and miraculously invoked flashes and bursts of light clouds and lightning
now because ordinary beings are swift to pay heed to miracles
the prince dropped like a felled tree at the pratyekabuddhas feet and said
noble one have you found such a store of qualities
i havethe prince thought if the small store of qualities this noble being has attained
he has attained with my help then this noble beings failure to get consent to go forth was due to his birth into a lowly family like his
my own failure to get consent to go forth was due to my birth into a high family such as mine
with that thought he prostrated at the pratyekabuddhas feet and made this prayer
by these roots of virtue may i be born not in a wealthy house nor in one that is poor let it be rather in a house of moderate means and always among many renunciants
monks the monk sariputra was at that time the prince
that action of making offerings and prayers to the pratyekabuddha ripened
so that now he was not born into too rich a family nor into too poor a family
but rather into a family of moderate means in which there were many renunciants
monks thus the ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negative while the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive
and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixed
monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions and seek wholly positive actions
monks this is how you should train
monks this is how you should train
still in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
the blessed one replied it is the prayers he made
reverend what has the venerable sariputra done that the ripened fruit of his action has led him to be singled out by the blessed one as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
one who knew the world an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata
what did he pray for
monks long ago during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years
the blessed buddha kasyapa appeared in the world
who lived and dwelt in the rsipatana deer park near varanasi
later as he was dying he made this prayer
he lived the holy life for the rest of his days but he did not attain any store of qualities
a monk he who would later become sariputra went forth into kasyapas teachings
and was singled out by the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
although i have spent my entire life living the holy life under kasyapa an arhat a blessed tathagata a perfectly awakened buddha and unsurpassed object of veneration
i have not attained any store of qualities
young brahmin in the future when the lifespan of beings is one hundred years
arhat and blessed tathagata and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa has prophesied to the young brahmin uttara saying
may the roots of virtue accumulated through living the holy life for my entire lifetime
you will become the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha
the knowledgeable and venerable one
the sugata the one who knows the world the unsurpassed guide who tames beings
the teacher to gods and men known as the blessed buddha sakyamuni
nd that i may go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
and just as i this master was singled out by the tathagata the arhat and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
king of the sakyas
actions never waste away
the virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated come to ripen upon the aggregates
elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them
monks actions and accumulations do not ripen upon the external elements
the element of water the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
monks maudgalyayana himself discovered the store of action mastered conditions
tended to them as one does an irrigation channel and emerged without indecision
he himself acted and accumulated thus so no one else experiences maudgalyayanas actions and accumulations for themselves
the blessed one replied
reverend what has the venerable the great maudgalyayana done
that the ripened fruit of his action has led to him being the most powerful and the greatest miracle worker
as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
because of that prayer sariputra has now been singled out by the tathagata
as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
may i too be singled out by the blessed sage of the sakyas lion of the sakyas
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons
when the time and the conditionsare right they alight upon embodied beings
monks long ago in a sanctuary not very far from the city of varanasi there lived a sage who personified loving kindness
endowed with compassion he was kind to all sentient beings
one day a poor man arrived at the sanctuary carrying a bundle of wood
the sage saw him put down his bundle of wood before sitting down to rest
feeling compassion for him he thought he has been born a human but because of faulty actions done in the past this afflicted man must struggle very hard to make a living
i shall allow his going forththe sage called out son who are you
noble one i am a poor man who makes his living from wood
well then why do you not go forth
noble one if i am a poor man who must work very hard to forge a living by selling wood
who would allow me to go forth
because the sage was the very personification of loving kindness he felt tremendous compassion for the man and asked
son do you wish to go forth
noble one i seek to go forth so in your love i ask that you allow me
the sage allowed him to go forth then washed a begging bowl and dyed a dharma robe and gave them to him saying
good man should you attain even the slightest store of qualities you must tell me
the man promised to do so and he went off into the wilds
without a teacher or a guide he gave rise to the thirtyseven qualities conducive to awakening
and actualized his own awakening
then he thought i promised to share any such attainment with that sage so i must do so
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
so out of the great love and compassion he felt like a swan spreading its wings
he flew up into the sky above and miraculously invoked flashes and bursts of light clouds and lightning
as ordinary beings are swift to pay heed to miracles
the sage dropped like a felled tree at the pratyekabuddhas feet and said
noble one have you found such a store of qualities
i havethe sage thought
the small store of qualities this noble being has attained he has attained with my help
and with that he prostrated at the pratyekabuddhas feet and made this prayer
just as this noble being is powerful and a great miracle worker
through these roots of virtue may i too become powerful and a great miracle worker
reverend what is it that the venerable the great maudgalyayana has done
that the ripened fruit of his action has led the blessed one to declare him as the greatest and most powerful miracle worker
in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions and seek wholly positive actions
monks this is how you should train
while the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixed
the blessed one replied it is the prayers he made what did he pray for
monks long ago during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years
the blessed buddha kasyapa appeared in the world
a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha
a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata one who knew the world
an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
who lived and dwelt in the rsipatana deer park near varanasi
was singled out by the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa as the greatest and most powerful miracle worker
a monk he who would later become maudgalyayana went forth into buddha kasyapas teachings and
he lived the holy life for the rest of his days but he did not attain any store of qualities
later as he was dying he made this prayer
i have spent my entire life living the holy life under kasyapa the blessed tathagata the arhat and perfectly awakened buddha and unsurpassed object of veneration
but i have not attained any store of qualities
may the roots of virtue accumulated through living the holy life for my entire lifetime
the knowledgeable and venerable one the sugata the one who knows the world
you will become the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha
young brahmin in the future when the lifespan of beings is one hundred years
and that i may go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
about whom the blessed tathagata and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa has prophesied to the young brahmin uttara saying
the unsurpassed guide who tames beings the teacher to gods and men known as the blessed buddha sakyamuni
may i too be singled out by the blessed sage of the sakyas lion of the sakyas king of the sakyas as the greatest and most powerful of miracle workers
because of that prayer maudgalyayana has now been singled out by the tathagata as the greatest and most powerful of miracle workers
and just as i this master was singled out by the tathagata the arhat and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa as the most powerful of the powerful and the greatest of miracle workers
still in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
reverend what is it that the venerable kosthila has done
that the ripened fruit of his action has led him to be singled out by the blessed one as supreme among those who have attained discerning wisdom
it is the prayers he made what did he pray for
monks long ago during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years
a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata
one who knew the world an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
the blessed buddha kasyapa appeared in the world
who lived and dwelt in the rsipatana deer park near varanasi
a monk he who would later become kosthila went forth into buddha kasyapas teachings
and was singled out by the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa as supreme among those who have attained discerning wisdom
he lived the holy life for the rest of his days but he did not attain any store of qualities
later as he was dying he made this prayer
i have spent my entire life living the holy life under kasyapa the blessed tathagata the arhat and perfectly awakened buddha and unsurpassed object of veneration
but i have not attained any store of qualities
may the roots of virtue accumulated through living the holy life for my entire lifetime
ensure that i may go forth into the teachings of buddha sakyamuni about whom the blessed tathagata the arhat and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa has prophesied to the young brahmin uttara
saying young brahmin in the future when the lifespan of beings is one hundred years
the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha the knowledgeable and venerable one the sugata
the one who knows the world the unsurpassed guide who tames beings the teacher to gods and men known as the blessed buddha sakyamuni
you will become
and that i may go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
as supreme among those who have attained discerning wisdom
and just as this master was singled out by the tathagata and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
may i too be singled out by the blessed sage of the sakyas lion of the sakyas king of the sakyas as supreme among those who have attained discerning wisdom
because of that prayer he has now been singled out by the tathagata as supreme among those who have attained discerning wisdom
granting ordination in the time of the blessed buddha one obtained the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya in the following way
come join me monk he obtained the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
the postulant was led before the blessed one knowing that when the blessed one said
thus when a person approached a monk with the wish to go forth
blessed buddha allowed the postulants going forth and ordained them with the words come join me monk
the postulant would make the following petition revered sangha please listen
i postulants name petition the sangha to allow my going forth and grant ordination into the monkhood
the postulant would make the following petition
revered sangha please listen
so the monks asked the blessed one about it and he said
if a person approaches a monk wishing to go forth
the monk should accept charge of him
once this is done and the entire sangha has assembled
the postulant should don the robes and prostrate to his seniors
the postulant should then kneel with palms joined and petition the sangha three times after which
the receiving monk makes a motion to ratify the petition the postulants going forth is allowed and he is ordained the moment this very act whose fourth member is a motion is accepted
they did not know how to do that
although the blessed one authorized the sangha to allow going forth and grant ordination
alas for those disciples who live a great distance away the journey can be arduous
he then said in the light of what has happened from this day forward i authorize the sangha to allow going forth and grant ordination the early rite
when the monks asked the blessed one about it he thought
i ask that the loving and reverend sangha in your love allow my going forth and confer ordination on me
this would be repeated a second and a third time the monks petition
after that one monk would act on the petition
while seated he would say the following
revered sangha please listen
postulants name has petitioned the sangha to allow his going forth and grant ordination into the monkhood
if the time is right and the sangha can allow it i ask that the sangha grant their consent
i ask that the sangha allow postulants name to go forth and grant him ordination
acting on the petition the petition would be acted on in the following way
if the sangha allows his going forth and grants ordination then i ask that any who can allow the going forth of the venerable postulants name and his ordination remain silent
i ask that any who cannot allow it speak up
after the first motion to act the motion would be repeated a second and a third time
the sangha would acknowledge its acceptance and
while there they would beg for food implore others to beg for food
grovel for soup implore others to grovel for soup and do still more that went against the teachings
while speaking shrilly and in loud voices and behaving wildly
they would go to the homes of brahmins and householders
without being well presented or well dressed
because those whose going forth was allowed and who were ordained under the early rite had no preceptor or instructor
thus went the early rite preceptors and instructors
give its consent that the going forth of such and such a monk be allowed and that he be granted ordination by remaining silent
this prompted tirthikas knowledgeable men and others
since these ascetic sons of the sakya have no preceptor and no instructor they go to the houses of brahmins and householders without being well presented or well dressed
while speaking shrilly and in loud voices and behaving wildly
while there they beg for food implore others to beg for food
grovel for soup and implore others to grovel for soup
to criticize disparage and slander them they would say
who would give these shavenheaded ascetics alms or think to help them
one sick monk even died for lack of someone to nurse him
when that occurred the monks asked the blessed one about it and the blessed one thought
i should authorize my disciples to act as preceptors and instructors so that they may allow others to go forth and care for the sick among them
the blessed one proclaimed after considering the matter i authorize preceptors and instructors to allow going forth and grant ordination
when the blessed one had authorized preceptors and instructors to allow going forth and grant ordination
the monks found themselves in a quandary for they did not know what serving as a preceptor or instructor entailed so the blessed one proclaimed
there are five types of instructors and two types of preceptors
what are these five types of instructors they are instructors of novices instructors who inquire into confidential matters
officiants givers of instruction and recitation instructors
what is an instructor of novices he is one who grants refuge and the foundations of the training
what is an instructor who inquires into confidential matters he is one who delves into private matters
what is an officiant he is one who moves to act upon an act whose fourth member is a motion
what is a giver of instruction he is one in whose presence you stay even for a single day
what is a recitation instructor he is one who recites even a single verse of four lines three times which you then repeat
what are the two types of preceptor they are those who allow going forth and those who grant ordination
when the blessed one authorized preceptors and instructors to allow going forth and grant ordination
the monks found themselves in a quandary for they did not know how to do that
so the blessed one proclaimed if someone approaches you with the wish to go forth
you should accept charge of him after having inquired into impediments he might face
once you have accepted charge of him and he has promised to seek refuge in the three jewels and live as a lay devotee
you should give him the laypersons vows
this is how to give the laypersons vows
first the postulant prostrates to the teacher
he then prostrates and kneels before the instructor joins his palms together and says
reverend heed me i postulants name will henceforth
for as long as i live seek refuge in the buddha supreme among men
i will seek refuge in the dharma supreme among all that is free from attachment
i will seek refuge in the sangha supreme among communities
for as long as i live i ask that you reverend accept me as a lay devotee
the postulant repeats this a second and a third time but in the third recitation says instructor
the instructor then says this is the procedure
at which point the lay devotee says it is excellent
pledging to keep the precepts
the postulant then expresses his commitment to the precepts with the following words
instructor heed me just as noble arhats renounced killing and swore to refrain from killing for as long as they lived
so do i
postulants name henceforth for as long as i live renounce killing and swear to refrain from killing
with this first branch i pledge to train in practice and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats
furthermore noble arhats renounced and swore to refrain from stealing sexual misconduct
lying and intoxicating substances like grain alcohol and its byproducts which leave one uninhibited
just so do i postulants name too
the instructor then says this is the procedure at which point the lay devotee says it is excellent
with this the fifth branch i pledge to train in practice and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats
for as long as i live renounce and swear to refrain from stealing sexual misconduct
this completes the ceremony by which a person becomes a lay devotee
a serious breach occurs if a petition is made without such inquiry
the monk informant then informs the sangha in the following way
he lays out his sleeping mat and strikes the wooden beam
he then properly summons the monks with words of invitation requesting the presence of the entire sangha
either in the usual way or by visiting them in their own dwellings
the monk informant then prostrates to the seniormost in the sangha before taking his place in a kneeling position
the monk informant asks the preceptor have you inquired into the confidential matters
the postulant then turns to the monk who will inform the sangha of his desire to go forth
with palms pressed together he informs the sangha with these words
i ask you reverend sangha to listen
the postulant postulants name has asked the preceptor preceptors name to allow his going forth
he seeks to leave the householders life with its white clothes and unshaven head and face and go forth in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
postulants name seeks to go forth and having shaven head and face to don the saffron robes
with perfect faith he seeks to go forth from home into homelessness under the guidance of this preceptor preceptors name
furthermore he is utterly free of impediments
the sangha reply if that is indeed the case he is utterly free of all impediments to his going forth being allowed
if they say that then all is well a serious breach occurs if they do not
that is how one informs the sangha of the wish to go forth
next a petition is made to the preceptor in the following way
the postulant prostrates to and then kneels before the preceptor
with palms pressed together he says
master heed me
i postulants name petition you master to serve as preceptor master please act as my preceptor
master as preceptor please allow my going forth
he repeats this a second and a third time but the third time he says preceptor in place of master
the preceptor then says this is the procedure
to which the person wishing to go forth says it is excellent
a monk is then assigned to shave the postulants head and face
the blessed one decreed
do not shave off all of his hair but rather leave a tuft of hair at his crown so after shaving off nearly all the postulants hair the monk should ask the postulant shall i cut this tuft
if he answers no do not cut it then tell him to go
but if he answers yes i am happy for you to do so then cut it
the postulant should then bathe if the weather is cold he may bathe with warm water
if the weather is warm he should bathe with cold water
the preceptor then gives him a begging bowl and saffron robes which he accepts after bowing at the preceptors feet
the preceptor then dresses the postulant checking to ensure he is not asexual
a pandaka or suffering from an excretory fistula
the blessed one decreed that postulants should be examined
but the embarrassment that the monks examination caused to the naked and exposed postulants prompted the blessed one to decree
do not examine him while naked examine him without his knowing while he is dressed only in a lower robe
that is how the first part of the ceremony should be performed
allowing going forth begins with the postulant going for refuge
the postulant first prostrates to the teacher
then prostrates to the preceptor and kneels before him
presses his palms together and says preceptor heed me
i postulants name will henceforth for as long as i live seek refuge in the buddha supreme among men
i will seek refuge in the dharma supreme among all that is free from attachment
i will seek refuge in the sangha supreme among communities
by the blessed one the tathagata the arhat the perfectly complete buddha sakyamuni
the lion of the sakyas the king of the sakyas
following the example of going forth set
i in going forth renounce the tokens of the householder life and fully embrace the tokens of the renunciant life
he repeats this a second and a third time
the preceptor then says this is the procedure
at which point the renunciant says it is excellent becoming a novice
the postulant is then directed to the monk who will induct him into the novitiate
the preceptor again asks the postulant whether he is utterly free of impediments
the postulant first prostrates to the teacher
and if he is the postulants induction into the novitiate begins with his going for refuge and promising to live as a novice this is how the postulant is inducted into the novitiate
then prostrates to and kneels before the instructor presses his palms together and says
reverend heed me i postulants name will henceforth
for as long as i live seek refuge in the buddha supreme among men
i will seek refuge in the dharma supreme among pure doctrines
i will seek refuge in the sangha supreme among communities
i ask that you reverend accept charge of me as a novice for as long as i live
the postulant repeats this a second and a third time but the third time he says instructor in place of reverend
the instructor then says this is the procedure
at which point the novice says it is excellent
a monk other than the instructor then consults the sundial and announces the month the day the time of day or night and the hour
the novice then pledges to keep the precepts in the following way
instructor heed me
just as noble arhats renounced and swore off killing for as long as they lived
so do i novices name henceforth for as long as i live renounce and swear to refrain from killing
with this first branch i pledge to train in practice and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats
furthermore noble arhats renounced stealing sexual misconduct lying
intoxicating substances like grain alcohol and its byproducts which leave one uninhibited singing
dancing music garlands perfumes jewelry cosmetics
tall seating grand seating untimely eating and accepting gold and silver
and thus ceased accepting gold and silver
just so henceforth for as long as i live so too do i novices name renounce stealing sexual misconduct lying
tall seating grand seating untimely eating and accepting gold and silver
thus will i cease to accept gold and silver
with these ten branches i too pledge to train in practice and act upon the precepts of those noble arhats
the instructor then says this is the procedure
at which point the novice says it is excellent
that marks the end of the novice investiture rite
when the novice reaches the age of twenty the preceptor gives him his begging bowl and dharma robes and requests the presence of a monk officiant
the preceptor also requests the presence of a monk who will inquire into confidential matters
and that of any other monk in the vicinity where the ceremony is to be performed
when the monks in the vicinity have gathered
they each individually investigate whether they have incurred any transgressions in the past half a month that need to be reined in confessed
or formally excused
recognizing those transgressions they make reparations by reining them in confessing them or having them formally excused
before taking their places
all of the sangha then take their places in concord or in an inner circle

to find leisure and opportunity is rare so heed them perfectly
knowing all the perfectly awakened one whose name denotes truth proclaimed that going forth is for the gracious and ordination for the pure
finally enjoin him in how he must practice
venerable as you have been ordained you must be conscientious
a monk ward or apprentice should do so with great vigor thinking
when for instance he attends to the dharma robes of a preceptor or instructor
a serious breach occurs if he should not exert himself
if he should exert himself then all is well
oh we shall work on the preceptor or instructors begging bowl or have another do so
when for instance he attends to the begging bowl of a preceptor or instructor
or moving about within fortynine fathoms of the monastery
drinking water paying reverence to a stupa in the vicinity of the monastery
with the exception of defecating urinating throwing away his toothbrush
the blessed one replied
monks i will lay out the appropriate conduct of a monk ward or apprentice
such a monk should not be given soap or a toothbrush
he should not be asked for prayers or looked to for answers
a section index not tending the begging bowl dharma robes
nursing regret view disciplinary acts clemency demotion probation and reinstatement
the monks asked the blessed one
for instructions on what to do when those who have gone forth and are ordained cannot consult seek counsel from or heed the preceptor or instructor
a monk ward or apprentice
such a monk should not be welcomed
may not wet sweep or apply fresh cow dung to a monastery or work on his begging bowl or dharma robes without first consulting a preceptor or instructor
should not undertake any activity without first consulting a preceptor or instructor
should do so with great vigor thinking
oh we shall work on the preceptor or instructors dharma robes or have another do so
a serious breach occurs if he should not exert himself
when for instance a preceptor or instructor falls ill
a monk ward or apprentice should think with great vigor
oh we shall work as the preceptor or instructors sickness attendants or have another do so
if in thinking of his preceptor or instructor he feels sorrow
oh i will dispel the sorrow i feel toward my preceptor or instructor
if in thinking of his preceptor or instructor he develops a negative view
or an act of suspension for refusal to give up deviant views
if he should exert himself then all is well
the sangha may mete out the following disciplinary acts on a preceptor or instructor
an act of censure an act of demotion an act of expulsion an act of reconciliation
an act of suspension for refusal to acknowledge an act of suspension for refusal to make reparations
if there is a desire to mete out such an act
oh i will discard the negative view that i have toward my preceptor or instructor
if he he should exert himself then all is well
or cause another who feels sorrow toward my preceptor or instructor to dispel that sorrow
if he should exert himself then all is well a serious breach occurs if he should not exert himself
if a demotion or a repeat demotion has already been imposed on a preceptor or an instructor
if a preceptor or an instructor were to incur a transgression requiring sangha intervention
if he should exert himself then all is well a serious breach occurs if he should not exert himself
if a preceptor or an instructor has served out a probation or a repeat probation
a monk ward or apprentice should plead with great vigor
oh the preceptor or instructor who has served out his probation or a repeat probation should be granted a reinstatement
as monk wards and apprentices treat preceptors and instructors just so should preceptors and instructors treat monk wards and apprentices but only if requested
the blessed buddha pledged to pass the rainy season at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
the venerable upasena had pledged to pass that same rainy season in some distant place after one year had passed
he took a ward allowed his going forth and ordained him
after the rainy season had passed upasena took up his dharma robes
this monk of two years and his ward of one took up their begging bowls and dharma robes
set out for and made their way in stages to sravasti
when they arrived upasena set down his begging bowl and dharma robe washed his feet
and went to the blessed one
having bowed his head at the blessed ones feet he sat off to one side
it is natural for blessed buddhas to welcome those monks that come to visit them with the words
monk where have you come from just now
where did you pledge to pass the rainy season and so the blessed one asked upasena these very questions
upasena who is this noble son with you reverend he is my ward
upasena how many years have you passed as a monk how many years has your ward passed
reverend i have passed two years while my ward has passed one
the blessed one said to the monks
reverend i have come from distant lands just now and i seek to speak with you about passing the rainy season in distant lands
monks the noble son upasena thought first only of gathering a following
a monk who has passed one year should not allow going forth should not grant ordination
should not serve as reliable instructors should not accept charge of novices nor should he live independently
nor should a monk of two years nor a monk of three years nor a monk of four years
nor a monk of five years nor a monk of six years nor a monk of seven years nor a monk of eight years
even a monk of nine years should not allow going forth should not grant ordination
a monk of ten years may allow going forth may grant ordination
may accept charge of novices may serve as reliable instructors and may live independently
for those lacking in such particulars who are immature dense
dimwitted or unskilled to allow going forth
alas it is impossible for those who have not disciplined themselves to discipline others
it is impossible for those who have not brought calm to themselves to bring calm to others
for those who have not themselves been freed to free others
for those who have not themselves reached quiescence to bring others to quiescence
or for those who have not themselves emerged from the muck to free others from the muck
once an elder who was immature dense dimwitted and unskilled allowed a follower from another tirthika tradition to go forth and granted him ordination
but not having received counsel or instruction at any time the convert offered back his training and fell away
at which point the monks appealed to the blessed one
the blessed one replied
in the light of such events only monks with ten years and five qualities may allow going forth
what are those five qualities that such a monk has been ordained for ten years or more
is able to nurse wards or apprentices or enlist others to do so
is able to assuage the guilt of wards or apprentices or enlist others to do so
is able to repudiate the deviant views that have arisen in wards or apprentices or enlist others to do so
and is able to allay unhappiness or enlist others to do so wherever he is should wards or apprentices feel sad

upasena asked the blessed buddha reverend the blessed one has said
those with ten years and five qualities may allow going forth grant ordination accept charge of novices serve as reliable instructors and live independently
what then reverend if a monk has been ordained for sixty years but cannot recite the pratimoksasutra or cannot read or recite its supplements
should he take up residence with another
upasena he should live in residence with another
reverend how should he be addressed
upasena he should be called an immature elder
where should he take up residence
if there is a senior exemplar he should take up residence with a senior exemplar
if there is no senior exemplar he should take up residence with a junior exemplar
what reverend should the exemplar be accorded
upasena he should be accorded with all of the above except prostrations
the blessed buddha pledged to pass the rainy season in the kalandakanivapa at the bamboo grove near rajagrha
at which point a small number of elder monks and a large number of new ones promised to pass the rainy season at rajagrha
after the three months of monsoon had passed the blessed one instructed the venerable ananda
go to the monks ananda and tell them the tathagata will travel the realm
as your task will be to accompany the tathagata on his travels through the realm happily ready your dharma robes
heeding the blessed ones instruction ananda replied i shall do as the reverend instructs
to the monks he said venerables the tathagata will travel the realm
your task is to accompany him on his travels so you should happily ready your dharma robes
venerable ananda replied the elder monks
we cannot travel the realm with the blessed one
for we are old
and the new monks said
venerable ananda we too cannot travel the realm with the blessed one
for we are new and our preceptors and instructors will not go
if our preceptors and instructors do not go we must return swiftly and thus
those who have sought a reliable instructor will have to seek another yet again
after the three months of monsoon had passed the blessed one donned his dharma robe
he then set out to travel the realm with a small entourage who carried with them their begging bowls and dharma robes
for blessed buddhas on a journey it is natural to wonder about the behavior of those who accompany them
were they properly trained were they properly clothed
did they carry their belongings or did they lack uniformity
while wondering thus blessed buddhas look upon them by turning to the right as an elephant would
thus on his journey the blessed buddha looked about by turning to the right as an elephant would
when the blessed buddha had done so he saw the tathagatas entourage to be small
though they see blessed buddhas may inquire about what they already know
though they already know they may inquireor even though they know they may not inquire
they inquire when the time is right not when the time has passed
their inquiries are meaningful not meaningless
in this way blessed buddhas dam the flow of meaningless inquiries
as blessed buddhas know the time for a meaningful inquiry
the blessed buddha asked ananda
what is the cause due to which the tathagatas companions are now so few
what are the circumstances for it
reverend a small number of elder monks and a large number of new monks discussed the matter during the rains retreat in rajagrha
the elder monks said
venerable ananda we cannot travel the realm with the blessed one
for we are old
and the new monks said venerable ananda we too cannot travel the realm with the blessed one
for we are new and our preceptors and instructors will not go
f our preceptors and instructors do not go we must return swiftly and thus
those who have sought a reliable instructor will have to seek another yet again
reverend that is the cause due to which the tathagatas companions are now so few
those are the circumstances for it
ananda i therefore decree that those with five years and five qualities should travel the realm without a reliable instructor
what are those five qualities that the monk knows what constitutes an offense knows what does not constitute an offense
knows what is light knows what is weighty
and knows how to recite the pratimoksasutra and its supplements
those with five years and five qualities should travel the realm without a reliable instructor
do not resent this
the venerable upali asked the blessed buddha
reverend the blessed one has said
what about a revered monk of six years
if he recites the pratimoksasutra and reads and recites its supplements
should he too travel the realm without a reliable instructor upali he should not stay
why is that you ask
for those in possession of the five qualities are reliable reverend as for one of four years
should he too travel the realm without a reliable instructor upali he should not travel the realm without a reliable instructor
for those who have passed five years are reliable
reverend as for one who has knowledge of the three and who has cast aside the three stains
if he has not five years or the five qualities
a section index the above section contains the following topics having passed ten years retain learned know elucidate able to inspire others to retain
learn able to inspire others to learn the two sets of perfection the lists of three
trainee nontrainee knowing how training comes about providing reliability seeking a reliable instructor knowledge of offenses and traveling the realm
this concludes the section on what constitutes a reliable monk
a summary tirthikas twenty years and novices not yet fifteen
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when an elder who was immature dense dimwitted and unskilled
allowed a follower of another tirthika tradition to go forth
the elder granted the tirthika ordination sparking a number of disputes between monks
after the tirthika had offered back his training and returned to his community of tirthikas
the monks asked the blessed one about it
this is how he responded
monks look at how that benighted man has turned his back on such a fine and wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya and returned to his community of tirthikas
monks it seems to me he is behaving like a dog wracked by hunger but refusing fine food and fare and eating excrement instead
monks this is how a benighted man acts who turns his back on such a fine and wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
and returns to his former community of tirthikas
then the blessed one declared
monks apart from our sakya kin and dreadlocked fireworshippers
the going forth of tirthikas who do not have a sense of reverence should not be allowed nor should they be ordained
if perchance a sakya kin should come under a tirthika banner
and if perchance he should seek monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
then monks his going forth should be allowed and he should be ordained
why is that
because monks i give kin exceptions to kin
if perchance a wanderer from another tirthika order should come
and he should seek monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
then monks understand that he should be allowed to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
monks if after having submitted to his station the follower of another tirthika order has a sense of reverence
his going forth should be allowed and he should be ordained
when the blessed one said that followers of other tirthika orders should be allowed to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
the monks were in a quandary not knowing how such robes should be given
monks instructed the blessed one
if a follower of another tirthika order wishing to go forth approaches any one of you
you should ascertain through questioning him whether he has any impediments
once you have ascertained this have him take the threefold refuge and after he commits himself to living as a lay devotee
give him the lay devotee vows
then as the entire sangha sits in concord have him prostrate to them in order of seniority before sitting in a squatting position
pressing his palms together he should say reverend sangha please heed me
i the tirthika tirthikas name wish to renounce this identity and go forth
i the tirthika tirthikas name petition the sangha to allow me to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
might allow me to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
i the tirthika tirthikas name ask that the reverend and compassionate sangha out of your compassion
this should be repeated a second and a third time
after which a monk moves the petition be acted upon
this is how the petition is made while seated the monk says reverend sangha please heed me
this tirthika tirthikas name wishes to renounce this identity and go forth
this tirthika has petitioned the sangha to allow him to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
if the reverend sangha can allow it
i ask the sangha to give its consent and
allow this tirthika to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
the petition is acted upon thus reverend sangha please heed me
this tirthika tirthikas name wishes to renounce this identity and go forth
therefore i ask the sangha that you allow him to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
if the sangha were to permit this action i would ask the venerables who can allow it to please remain silent
those who cannot allow it please speak up
that is the first motion to act
this should be repeated a second and a third time
upali asked the blessed buddha
his robes are the preceptors responsibility his duties are akin to those in the novice ranks
for any tirthika to whom the sangha gives its permission to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
his food is the sanghas responsibility
the sangha by remaining silent acknowledges its acceptance and gives its consent for the tirthika tirthikas name to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four months
reverend the blessed one has said
speak too the praises of the dharma and the sangha and speak them perfectly
upali in the presence of the follower of another tirthika order speak the buddhas praises perfectly
if so then reverend by what measure may we say that a follower of another tirthika order has a sense of reverence
if after having submitted to his station the follower of another tirthika order has a sense of reverence
his going forth should be allowed and he should be ordained
why
it is because monks they argue for karma they argue for action
they argue for causes and they argue for diligence
monks the going forth of dreadlocked fireworshippers should be allowed and they should be ordained
upali by that measure we may say the tirthika has a sense of reverence
therefore monks you too should train so that you come to argue for karma
for actions for causes and for diligence monks that is how you should train
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when mahamaudgalyayana allowed the going forth of upali and a band of seventeen healthy new youths and ordained them
but upali when you speak perfectly the praises of the buddha the dharma and the sangha
and also speak perfectly of the tirthikas unworthiness
speak perfectly of the tirthikas unworthiness
upali when you speak of these things perfectly
if the follower of this other order becomes upset disturbed or angry
or if he sits withdrawn or seethes with anger
it can be said that the follower does not have a sense of reverence
if the follower of this other tirthika order does not become upset disturbed or angry if he does not sit withdrawn or seethe with anger then
come twilight reduced and wracked by hunger as they were they would cry out
and the blessed one would hear these great many cries from within the monasterys grounds
though they hear blessed buddhas may inquire about what they already know
though they already know they may inquireor even though they know they may not inquire
they inquire when the time is right not when the time has passed
their inquiries are meaningful not meaningless
in this way blessed buddhas dam the flow of meaningless inquiries
as blessed buddhas know the time for a meaningful inquiry
the blessed buddha asked the venerable ananda
who are these great many young boys who cry within the monasterys grounds at twilight
reverend it is upali and a band of seventeen healthy new youths whom mahamaudgalyayana allowed to go forth and has ordained
at twilight it is they who reduced and wracked by hunger cry out
ananda do monks grant ordination into the monkhood to persons who have not yet reached twenty years
reverend they do ananda ones so young should not be ordained
persons who are not yet twenty years of age cannot accept all they may be subjected to
the cold the heat the hunger the thirst
the blowflies the gadflies the gnats the wind the sun
physical pains that are intolerable oppressive intense dreadful and lifethreatening
the snakes the abuse hurled at them the bad that befalls them or the
their nature is such that they cannot abide or withstand their longing for defilements
persons who have reached twenty years of age on the other hand can accept all they may be subjected to
the bad that befalls them
or the physical pains that are intolerable oppressive intense dreadful and lifethreatening
their nature is such that they can abide and withstand their longing for defilements
the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks granting ordination into the monkhood to persons who have not yet reached twenty years
then he decreed in the light of this
monks should not grant ordination into the monkhood to persons who have not yet reached twenty years
if someone wishing to be ordained approaches any of you ask him if he has reached twenty years
if you grant ordination without asking this a serious breach occurs
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when a householder living in sravasti took a wife of equal caste
is he to go forth as well yes noble one he is
the monk replied who is this lad with you he is my son
and together they sported made love and indulged all of their desires
he said noble one i seek to go forth
the wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all of his desires gave birth to a son who was nurtured and grew until he was big
at a certain point the householders kin had dwindled his riches had dwindled
and his possessions had dwindled prompting the thought
as i am grown old and cannot gain more riches
i shall go forth he then said this to his son
where they approached a monk and
who replied father if you are to go forth then i too shall go forth son let us do just that said the householder he took his son and went to the jetavana
as the monk had taken a liking to them he allowed their going forth
for the next two or three days he trained them in their appropriate conduct
and then said gentlemen game does not eat other game
the whole of sravasti is your field and fatherland so seek out alms and live on them
early the next morning the father put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes
and went to beg alms in sravasti with his novice son
seeing a burnt piece of bread in the market the novice said
father ask the shopkeeper to give me the bread
sir please give this novice bread said the father
the shopkeeper replied noble one no one eats for free
so i would ask a few coins in return
sir we are renunciants how could we have a few coins
noble one did you raise this novice while a renunciant or householder
a householder
then give him what you earned while a householder
this novice is but one of many who beg come let us go
saying this the father grabbed out for his sons hand but his son jumped back fell down and began to cry
a crowd of bystanders saw the two and asked
gentlemen to whom does this novice belong he is my son his father said
why did you make the fruit of your loins go forth they asked
since the bystanders denounced disparaged and insulted him the monks asked the blessed one about it
and the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing persons who have not yet reached fifteen yearsto go forth
then he decreed that being the case monks should not allow persons under fifteen years old to go forth
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you ask him if he has reached fifteen years
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you ask him if he has reached fifteen years
if you allow going forth without so asking a serious breach occurs
a summary the chapters are of two novices those in servitude debtors
those without consent without consultation invalids and the sakyas
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when two of upanandas novices kantaka and mahaka
flirted with groped and tickled one another
they acted as a man does with a woman or as a woman does with a man
once when they were behaving like this the monks asked the blessed one about it
and the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks placing two novices together
he then decreed in the light of this monks should not place two novices together
if you do so a serious breach occurs
after the blessed one had so decreed sure enough two brothers turned up saying
we two shall go forth together at the same time when that occurred
the monks did not allow their going forth so the two of them left without going forth
the monks asked the blessed one about it
and the blessed one decreed
if two brothers turn up as they are sure to saying we two shall go forth together at the same time
their going forth should be allowed
once they have gone forth they should be ordained if they have reached twenty years
when that proved to be an impediment to monkhoodthe state of having gone forth and been ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
if one should have reached twenty years
then he should be ordained while the other should be left a novice
if neither has reached twenty years
then you should take charge of one while entrusting the other to a monk friend of yours
the one he is entrusted to shall ordain him for the blessed one decreed
whoever that may be it is he that should grant ordination
if ordination was not given the blessed one decreed
induce him to grant what was not given
while the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove
near sravasti there was a householder living in sravasti with a clever servant who was industrious
assured in his work and the first to any task no matter how small
at a certain point the householder insulted his servant prompting the servant to think
this householder is hard to please and i cannot guard my mind against his abuse
i ought to run away but leaving ones own land behind is hard
so instead i shall go forth among the ascetic sons of the sakya for they have secured from the king the liberty of a prince
with that he went to jetavana
where he approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
after allowing his going forth and ordaining him
the monk gave him instructions
to these the former servant applied himself with diligence energy and exertion so that he abandoned all disturbing emotions
and actualized arhatship becoming an arhat free of attachment to the three realms
for whom filth was equal to gold for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand
whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood
and whose knowledge had rent open the shell
he attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdom
he turned his back on worldly gain desires and esteem and was revered honored and praised by indra and the gods who attend him
the householder meanwhile was feeling regret
if my servant was first to all of my tasks no matter how small
why did i insult him
if i see him now i will beg his forgiveness
with that he sat down at the gates to sravasti
the next morning the monk put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes and was preparing to beg alms in sravasti
when the householder saw him and said
sir if you have gone forth who will attend me
come back as the householder reached out to grab at him the monk
like a kingly swan taken to wing flew up into the sky above blazing
and brilliant as a miraculous show of rain and thunder began
because ordinary beings are quick to heed a miracle
the householder dropped like a felled tree at the monks feet and asked
noble one have you found such a store of qualities i have
the householder provided the monk with all the provisions he would need
and word spread everywhere that the servant of this householder had gone forth and attained a store of qualities
when prasenajit the king of kosala heard that this servant had gone forth and attained a store of qualities he summoned his ministers and said
gentlemen as the ruler of all who have been crowned and anointed ksatriya kings
i declare that henceforth any servant who should wish to go forth shall not be prevented from doing so
in sravasti there lived a different householder with a clever servant who was industrious
assured in his work and first to any task no matter how small
at a certain point the householder insulted his servant prompting the servant to think
this householder is hard to please and i cannot guard my mind against his abuse
i ought to run away but leaving ones own land behind is hard
so instead i shall go forth among the ascetic sons of the sakya for they have secured from the king the liberty of a prince
with that he went to jetavana where he approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
after allowing his going forth and ordaining him the monk trained him for the next two or three days in his appropriate conduct and then said
sir game does not eat other game
the whole of sravasti is your field and fatherland so seek out alms and live on them
the householder meanwhile was feeling regret
if he was first to all of my tasks no matter how small why did i insult him
if i see him now i will beg his forgiveness
with that he sat down at the gates to sravasti
the next morning the monk put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes
and was preparing to beg alms in sravasti when the householder saw him and said
sir if you have gone forth who will attend me
come back as the householder reached out to grab at him
the monk said the king has given us a princes liberty
if you touch me i shall cut your hand off at the wrist
as such words put to flame the virtuous ways of the ascetic sons of the sakya
and put to flame the ways of brahmins
the allowing of this servants going forth was denounced disparaged and criticized
the monks then asked the blessed one about it and he thought
and he thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing the going forth of servants
then he decreed that being the case monks should not allow the going forth of servants
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you ask him you are not a servant are you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
while the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
a debtor was repaying the principle and interest of a debt in timely fashion to a householder living in sravasti
at a certain point the householder unexpectedly accosted the debtor saying
i demand you repay the principle and interest in their entirety all at once
after agreeing to a short window for repayment he released the debtor who thought
this householder is hard to please and i cannot repay the principle and interest all at once
i ought to run away but leaving ones own land behind is hard
so instead i shall go forth among the ascetic sons of the sakya for they have secured from the king the liberty of a prince
with that he went to jetavana where he approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
after allowing the debtors going forth and ordaining him the monk gave him instructions
to these he applied himself with diligence energy and exertion
o that he abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship
becoming an arhat free of attachment to the three realms
for whom filth was equal to gold for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand
desires and esteem and was revered honored
he attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdom he turned his back on worldly gain
whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood and whose knowledge had rent open the shell
praised by indra and the gods who attend him
the householder meanwhile was feeling regret
if he was giving me the principle and interest in a timely fashion why did i accost him
if i see him now i will beg his forgiveness
with that he sat down at the gates to sravasti
the next morning the monk put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes
and was preparing to beg alms in sravasti when the householder saw him and said
sir if you have gone forth who will repay the principle and interest in a timely fashion
come back as the householder reached out to grab at him
the monk like a kingly swan taken to wing flew up into the sky above
blazing and brilliant as a miraculous show of rain and thunder began
as ordinary beings are quick to heed a miracle the householder dropped like a felled tree
at the monks feet and asked
noble one have you found such a store of qualities i have attained them
i declare that henceforth any debtor who should wish to go forth shall not be prevented from doing so
when prasenajit the king of kosala heard this debtor had gone forth and attained a store of qualities
the householder provided the monk with all the provisions he would need
and word spread everywhere that the debtor of this householder had gone forth and attained a store of qualities
he summoned his ministers and said gentlemen as the ruler of all who have been crowned and anointed ksatriya kings
in sravasti a different debtor was repaying the principle and interest of a debt in timely fashion to a householder
at a certain point the householder unexpectedly accosted the debtor saying
i demand you repay the principle and interest in their entirety all at once
after agreeing to a short window for repayment he released the debtor who thought
as this householder is hard to please and i cannot repay the principle and interest all at once i ought to run away
but leaving ones own land behind is hard
so instead i shall go forth among the ascetic sons of the sakya for they have secured from the king the liberty of a prince
with that he went to jetavana where he approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
after allowing his going forth and ordaining him for the next two or three days he trained him in his appropriate conduct
and then said sir game does not eat other game
the whole of sravasti is your field and fatherland so seek out alms and live on them
meanwhile the householder was feeling regret and thought
if he was repaying the principle and interest in timely fashion
why did i accost him
if i see him now i will beg his forgiveness
with that he sat down at the gates to sravasti
the next morning the monk put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes
and was preparing to beg alms in sravasti
when the householder saw him and said
sir if you have gone forth who will repay the principle and interest in timely fashion
come back as the householder reached out to grab at him the monk said
the king has given us a princes liberty if you touch me i shall cut your hand off at the wrist
as such words put to flame the virtuous ways of the ascetic sons of the sakya
and put to flame the ways of brahmins
the allowing of this debtors going forth was denounced disparaged and criticized
disparaged and criticized
the monks asked the blessed one about it and
the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing the debtorss going forth
then the blessed one decreed in the light of this monks should not allow debtors going forth
if someone wishing to be allowed to go forth approaches any of you ask him you arent a debtor are you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when a householder living in sravasti took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all of their desires
the wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all of his desires
then gave birth to a son who was nurtured and grew until he was big
at a certain point the householder insulted his son prompting his son to think
this father of mine is hard to please and i cannot guard my mind against his abuse
i ought to run away but leaving ones own land behind is hard
so instead i shall go forth among the ascetic sons of the sakya for they have secured from the king the liberty of a prince
with that he went to jetavana where he approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
after the monk gave him refuge and the precepts the son requested him to serve as his monk petitioner
as the monk who cuts his hair and beard as the monk who oversees bathing
and as the monk who inducts him into the novitiate
then after his going forth was allowed he again requested him
then after his going forth was allowed he again requested him this time to serve as the monk officiant
his final request to him was to serve as the monk who inquires into confidential matters
after the son had appealed to the monk to serve in all of these capacities
the householder who was the ordinands father arrived during the ordination ceremony and asked the monk
noble one have you seen a lad fitting the description of my son
the monk replied i petitioned on his behalf i cut his hair and beard
i oversaw his bath i inducted him into the novitiate and i ordained him
what constituted spiritual practice how to attain perfect fulfillment of his greatest desire
after the son was ordained they measured the shadows and noted the time of day and the hour
they made sure he knew the foundations what things brought about offenses
and how to practice the equally applicable ethical code
they enjoined him to adhere to his role model
to dwell in tranquility to acquire what is needed
to do what he must do to fully understand his unspoken commitments
to heed what he reveres and told him
you have been ordained into the teachings of the most wise to find leisure and opportunity is rare so heed them perfectly
knowing all the perfectly awakened one whose name denotes truth proclaimed that going forth is for the gracious and ordination for the pure
and they enjoined him in what he must practice and how
as the newly ordained monk committed to these things his father the householder arrived and asked
noble one why are you just sitting there with a razor in your hand
if he has lost faith in me that will be an impediment to his living the holy life
goodness where is the harm in waiting seven or eight days
goodness where is the harm in waiting seven or eight days
the monks then asked the blessed one about it and the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks not waiting seven or eight days for consent from the parents of one wishing to go forth
then he decreed in the light of this if someone approaches any of you wishing to go forth who has parents who are alive but have not granted him consent
wait seven or eight days
but later after the blessed one had said if someone approaches you wishing to go forth wait seven or eight days
others arrived wishing to go forth whose parents had granted them consent as did others coming from afar whose parents could not be consulted
when this occurred the monks made them too wait seven or eight days and so some left without having been allowed to go forth
when that proved to be an impediment to monkhood the state of having gone forth and been ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
the monks asked the blessed one about it
and the blessed one decreed
whoever comes with his parents consent
and whoever comes from so far away that his parents cannot be consulted their going forth should be allowed
this you need not regret
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
made love and indulged all of their desires
when a householder living in sravasti took a wife of equal caste and together they sported
the wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all of his desires then gave birth to a son
upon which occasion the householder said mistress as we must repay our debts and build our wealth
i shall go to trade in another land
son of a lord do as you wish
with that he set out for another land to trade
and in this land he suffered misfortune
his wife gave guardianship of their son to relatives while supporting and providing for him through her own industry
once he had grown she placed him under the tutelage of a court scribe
while other boys of the lads age had already mastered their letters and had begun to study the grammar treatises
he was still struggling to learn his letters
his mother went to the court scribe and said
master whatever the other boys of the lads age may offer you i too will give you
those boys have already mastered their letters and have begun to study the grammar treatises
while this lad is still learning his letters
the court scribe replied there are two factors in honing ones intelligence
the first is a sense of modesty which pertains to oneself another is a sense of propriety which pertains to others
this lad has no modesty nor does he have any sense of propriety
for this you too are at fault for you object when i strike him
i am guilty of that as you say she responded
and i do object to your striking him
another time the court scribe struck him and the lad went off crying to his mother
his mother asked him son why are you crying
mother the court scribe struck me
his mother then struck him too prompting the lad to think
both are at fault before i was only struck in one place
now i am struck in both i cannot bear being hurt in both places so i will run away
with that he set out for jetavana where he saw a novice picking flowers and said
noble one you look so happy why
it is because i have gone forth why dont you go forth
noble one who can allow my going forth the novice said
the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing going forth without consulting the sangha
the monks appealed to the blessed one
when that proved to be an impediment to monkhood the state of having gone forth and been ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
why have you gone forth amongst these thieving sons of the sakya
come back grabbing him with both hands she dragged him home
that being the case monks should not allow going forth without consulting the sangha
no one had heard any word of you
son i went searching for you among the ascetics in the forest among the tirthika communities and in other places but everywhere i looked
she went to sravasti and waited at the gate
but wherever she asked no one had heard any word of him
she went searching for the boy asking for word from the ascetics in the forest among the tirthika communities and in other places
the court scribe said you should go and look for him
she replied he has run away
who asked where is the lad today i struck him i too struck him today
preceptor this son of noble family seeks to go forth i ask that you allow his going forth
come let us go before a preceptor and led him away when they arrived before a preceptor the novice said
and with that the preceptor allowed his going forth his mother went to the court scribe
in the morning the novice put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes
and was preparing to beg alms in sravasti with the ascetic attendant novice in tow
when she saw her son she beat her fists on his chest and cried
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you have him petition the sangha
if you allow going forth without consulting them a serious breach occurs
the blessed buddha was resident at the kalandakanivapa in the bamboo grove near rajagrha
when a brahmin living in rajagrha took a wife of equal caste and together they sported
made love and indulged all of their desires
the wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all of his desires later gave birth to a son
who was nurtured and grew until he was big
at a certain point he fell ill and when every doctor had given up hope his mother said to him
son the physician kumarabhrta is the unsurpassed king of doctors
to him you must go
he went before the physician and pleaded
physician please cure me sir replied the physician your condition is hard to cure
neither i nor anyone else can cure you
and i am physician to the blessed buddha and his community of disciples
as well as to the king the queen and their court
he went to his mother who asked
son did you go to the physician mother i went to the physician
who told me my condition is hard to cure
that he is physician to the blessed buddha and his community of disciples
in that case son go forth
mother as i am of the highest caste
how could i go forth into the mixed caste order of the ascetic sons of the sakya
son has your brain turned to hay or are you just babbling
he went to the bamboo grove where he approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
as soon as the monk allowed his going forth he sat down moaning
the monk asked him why do you sit and moan
preceptor i am unwell
sir why have you fallen ill upon going forth
preceptor i have not fallen ill upon going forth
i was already unwell when i went forth
i was already unwell when i went forth
why did you not tell me
preceptor he replied what would you have said to me
the preceptor was seated unhappy when his wards and apprentices happened by and asked
preceptor why do you sit here thus so unhappy
boys i have allowed the going forth of an invalid son of noble family so i will have to place him in the infirmary
preceptor they replied the blessed one has said there are two types of saints
those who do not assume burdens they do not bear and those who carry through to the end those burdens they bear
you must carry through to the end this burden you bear
as they stood discussing the matter amongst themselves the physician passed by and they inquired of him
physician kumarabhrta what illness is this please have a look
it is a grave illness he replied
have the king provide all that is required and i shall try to cure him
but he will only recover quickly if you noble ones nurse him the physician then treated the invalid and he was cured
the newly cured monk said preceptor i have achieved the aim i had in going forth
son have you actualized arhatship he asked no preceptor i have not
well then have you actualized a nonreturners fruition a oncereturners fruition
a streamenterers fruition no preceptor i have not
but i was unwell then i went forth and now am cured
he asked son where will you go i will return home preceptor
sir the preceptor said having gone forth in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
you have not attained any of the four fruitions of spiritual practice for which it was taught
do you seek to squander the offerings of the faithful and invite misfortune
dismissing his preceptors words the monk departed
knowing what had been done for him he gave the physician sprigs flowers fruits and sticks of neem
sir what would you like from me asked the physician
he replied i seek nothing in return i have sought you out in order to give you these offerings
sir what did i do for you he asked
you cured me when i was unwell
i dont recall that replied the physician
i will refresh your memory he said and reminded him
at this point the physician said sir having gone forth in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
you have not attained any of the four fruitions of spiritual practice for which it was taught
do you seek to squander the offerings of the faithful and invite misfortune
then physician thought to himself this is my responsibility and my responsibility alone so i must go see the blessed one
the physician kumarabhrta went to see the blessed one
and on arriving bowed his head at the blessed ones feet before taking a seat off to one side
as he sat off to one side the physician requested the blessed one
reverend the noble monks allowing the going forth of invalid sons of noble families
and their ordination will at some point cause even the kings treasury and stores to dwindle diminish
and come to an end
it will cause even my body to flag and the virtuous endeavors of noble beings to wane
o blessed one it would be good if you in your compassion
would give some consideration to prohibiting the noble ones from allowing the going forth of invalid sons of noble families and ordaining them
by keeping silent the blessed one assented to the physicians request
understanding the blessed ones silence to be assent
the physician bowed his head at the blessed ones feet and took his leave
the blessed one thought all those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing the going forth of invalids
then he decreed that being the case monks should not allow the going forth of invalids
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
ask him you are not an invalid are you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
while the blessed buddha was resident at the banyan grove near kapilavastu
he allowed the going forth of members from each sakya family in kapilavastu
their relatives came to see the newly ordained who taught the dharma to their assembled family members
king suddhodana heard the sound of a great many sakya women crying out in misery
overwhelmed by grief the sakya women cried out in misery in the twilight in the twilight
and they in turn upon hearing the dharma sought to go forth on the spot
among those who upon hearing the dharma were allowed to go forth on the spot were the fathers of some sakya women their brothersinlaw their husbands brothers and sons
hearing their cries he asked the sakyas
gentlemen why do so many sakya women cry out in misery in the twilight
your majesty they replied
the going forth of certain noble ones and sons of noble families has been allowed and they have been ordained without the consent of their parents
the going forth of the fathers brothersinlaw husbands brothers and sons of some sakya women has also been allowed
this is my responsibility and my responsibility alone thought king suddhodana
so i must go to see the blessed one
the sakya women cry out in misery in the twilight
king suddhodana went to see the blessed one and on arriving
bowed his head at the blessed ones feet before taking a seat off to one side
the king then said to the blessed one
blessed one i have a worthy suit
tathagata i have a worthy suit
great king if you insist on passing up the boons of the tathagatas arhats and perfectly complete buddhas
tell me what favor could i grant you
one that noble beings would find easy
if i find it easy i shall grant it
reverend when the blessed one was born the blessed one was destined to become king of the world
i even thought i would soar through the sky and see the four continents
my delight and pleasure being not inconsiderable
reverend when the blessed one became a renunciant
what hopes i had for you to become king of the world were dashed
so instead i went on to think that the prince sundarananda would conquer and become king of the world
reverend if only it were otherwise and your parents could have found satisfaction in you
when those hopes were shown to be just that and the prince rahulabhadra became a renunciant
what hopes i had for becoming a king of real command were completely and utterly dashed too
so instead i then went on to think that the prince rahulabhadra would become a king of real command
when those hopes were shown to be just that and the prince sundarananda became a renunciant
the hopes i had for conquering and for becoming king of the world were dashed too
reverend these noble monks are allowing the going forth of sons of noble families and ordaining them without their parents consent
o blessed one it would be good if in your compassion
you were to give some consideration to prohibiting the noble ones from allowing the going forth of sons of noble families and their ordination without their parents consent
by keeping silent the blessed one assented to king suddhodana
understanding the blessed ones silence to be assent
king suddhodana bowed his head at the blessed ones feet and took his leave
the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing the going forth of sons of noble families and their ordination without their parents consent
he then decreed
in the light of this monks should not allow the going forth of sons of noble families or ordain them without their parents consent
if someone approaches any of you wishing to go forth ask him have your parents given their consent
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
after the blessed one had decreed a monk should not allow the going forth of sons of noble families or ordain them without their parents consent
the monks asked the blessed one about it and he decreed
those who come without their parents consent from faraway lands where their parents cannot be consulted should be allowed to go forth
when that proved to be an impediment to monkhood the state of having gone forth and been ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
the monks did not allow others to go forth who came
thus their going forth not allowed the hopefuls turned back
without their parents consent from faraway lands where their parents could not be consulted
a summary scaring away a crow violators impostors pandakas creatures tirthikas matricides and patricides scaring away a crow
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when the ignorant virudhaka had slaughtered the sakya inhabitants of kapilavastu
although they had not been aggressive antagonistic or thieving
the two sons of the venerable anandas younger sister were left orphaned
and were wandering aimlessly when traders from sravasti on their way to kapilavastu on business recognized the two goodlooking lads and asked
boys where are your parents they were killed by the ignorant virudhaka they replied
if your uncle the famous monk known as reverend ananda is staying in sravasti why dont you go there
they replied who would take us there we will take you
after they traded their goods and made a profit the traders set out for sravasti with the two boys in tow
they left the boys at the gate of the jetavana
where the venerable ananda recognized them and asked
boys where are your parents
they were killed by the ignorant virudhaka
because ananda cared for his kin on hearing of their death he became choked with tears
the monks asked him venerable ananda who are these two lads
they are my sisters boys
why dont you take them in
if these two boys offer the monks herbs flowers and fruits
i barely get enough from begging to fill my own stomach he replied where out there can i get enough to provide for them
in return the monks will give them the leftovers from their begging bowls
after being taken in the boys began to offer the monks herbs flowers and fruits
and in return the monks gave them the leftovers from their begging bowls
after a few days of giving the two their leftovers they stopped
so ananda went out and about begging alms but received only just enough to fill his own stomach
eating half himself and giving the other half to the two boys he became pallid emaciated feeble withered thin and weak
although they know blessed buddhas may inquire about what they already know
though they already know they may inquireor even though they know they may not inquire
they inquire when the time is right not when the time has passed
heir inquiries are meaningful not meaningless
in this way blessed buddhas dam the flow of meaningless inquiries
as blessed buddhas know the time for a meaningful inquiry
the blessed buddha asked the monks
monks why has the monk ananda become pallid emaciated feeble withered thin and weak
blessed one they replied since the two sons of the venerable anandas younger sister were orphaned
he has gone out receiving only enough alms to fill his own mouth half of which he takes for himself while the other half he gives to them
this has reduced the venerable ananda to such a state
the blessed one then asked the venerable ananda
will you not allow these two boys going forth
blessed one i will allow their going forth
the blessed one decreed in the light of that i give permission for food given to the sangha to be given to those wishing to go forth
after the blessed one gave permission for food that has been given to the sangha to be given to those wishing to go forth
the monks gave them food for a few days and then began to complain
the blessed one then asked ananda a second time
did you refuse to allow these two boys going forth
reverend the two of them are not yet fifteen
can the two boys scare crows away from the sanghas sleeping quarters reverend they can throw stones
in that case ananda i give my permission to allow freely the going forth of those as young as seven years old provided they can scare away crows
ananda then allowed the two to go forth
after anandas nephews went forth ananda began to teach them to read
but after a few days of study they began to misbehave
the venerable mahamaudgalyayana asked ananda
why do you not make these two novices study
elder replied ananda they do not listen to me i do not know what to do
but i must compel these two novices to study
mahamaudgalyayana replied elder do as you say
so ananda began to make the two novices study
but again after a few days the two of them began to misbehave and ananda asked mahamaudgalyayana
elder why can i not make these two novices study
ananda these two will not yet listen to me either
elder the two novices must be given a little scare
the venerable mahamaudgalyayana said to the two
novices lets do our daily practice
yes noble one bring something to sit on
mahamaudgalyayana then took the two novices for their daily practice
on the way mahamaudgalyayana conjured up an apparition of beings in the hell realms
who cried out from being cut sliced crushed and hacked to pieces
the two boys exclaimed noble one what is this have a closer look he replied
the two of them approached and found what was being done therethe cutting the slicing the crushing and the hacking to pieces
some were being sliced apart by saws
some were being ground in mills
and some were being melted down in boiling vats when they saw two boiling iron vats standing there empty they asked
gentlemen will no one be put into these two no they replied
for the two sons of noble anandas sister have gone forth and yet lazily pass their time
when their time has come and they die they will be reborn here so these two vats have been reserved for them
terrified they thought if were recognized theyll put us in those vats this very day
and began to look all about them
they went to mahamaudgalyayana who asked
did you see something noble one we did
what beings in the hell realms
what were they doing there
they were doing all sorts of thingscutting slicing crushing hacking to pieces
for the two sons of noble anandas sister have gone forth and yet lazily pass their time
when their time has come and they die theyll be reborn here so these two have been reserved for them
then mahamaudgalyayana advised thus novices knowing that disadvantages such as these
and others too accrue from laziness apply yourselves diligently
the two nephews began to apply themselves to their studies with diligence
seeing no gods in either palace they inquired
and the sughosak to where there stood two palaces strewn with beds and divans replete with goddesses
the two of them approached and followed the sounds of the vina ektara balari mahati
noble one what is this have a closer look he replied
along with the sounds of the vina ektara balari mahati and the sughosak the two boys exclaimed
on the way mahamaudgalyayana conjured up an apparition of the gods
mahamaudgalyayana then took the two novices for their daily practice
we will go but we will not return to that one place bring something to sit on
mahamaudgalyayana said to the two novices lets go for our daily practice noble one they replied
elder now they must be inspired
ananda the two have become dispirited
thus it was that the two of them became pallid emaciated feeble withered thin and weak mahamaudgalyayana said
if they thought of the beings in the hell realms in the morning
they would not even eat if they thought of them in the afternoon they would vomit up what they had eaten
when we saw two boiling iron vats standing empty we asked
gentlemen will no one be put into these two and they replied no
mistresses are there no gods in either of these palaces
no there are none why is that
then taking dirt from the tip of his fingernail the blessed one asked the monks
the two of them began to apply themselves to their studies and receive instructions after a time they came across the following passage in the nidanasamyukta
reverend the dirt the blessed one takes from the tip of his fingernail is less
much less a great deal less entirely less
if we used those specks to produce all the dirt on the earth
it would not amount to even one hundredth it would not amount to one thousandth of it or one hundred thousandth of it
it would not equal match number compare to or cause it
monks the blessed one replied
sentient beings equal in number to the particles of dirt on the earth
die among hell realm beings only to be reborn among hell realm beings
while sentient beings equal in number only to the particles of dirt on the tip of my fingernail die among hell realm beings
and are reborn among humans
die among hell realm beings only to be reborn among animals
die among hell realm beings only to be reborn among spirits
and are reborn among gods
while sentient beings equal in number only to the particles of dirt on the tip of my fingernail
die among hell realm beings and are reborn among gods
sentient beings equal in number to the particles of dirt on the earth
die among hell realm beings only to be reborn among spirits
die among animals only to be reborn among animals
die among animals and are reborn among humans
die among animals only to be reborn among hell realm beings
die among animals only to be reborn among spirits
die among animals and are reborn among gods
while sentient beings equal in number only to the particles of dirt on the tip of my fingernail
die among animals and are reborn among gods
sentient beings equal in number to the particles of dirt on the earth
die among animals only to be reborn among spirits
die among spirits only to be reborn among spirits
die among spirits and are reborn among humans
die among spirits only to be reborn among hell realm beings
die among spirits only to be reborn among animals
die among spirits and are reborn among gods
while sentient beings equal in number only to the particles of dirt on the tip of my fingernail
die among spirits and are reborn among gods
sentient beings equal in number to the particles of dirt on the earth
die among spirits only to be reborn among animals
die among gods only to be reborn among hell realm beings
die among gods and are reborn among gods
die among gods only to be reborn among animals
die among gods only to be reborn among spirits
die among humans only to be reborn among hell realm beings
die among humans and are reborn among humans
die among humans only to be reborn among animals
sentient beings equal in number to the particles of dirt on the earth
die among humans only to be reborn among spirits
while sentient beings equal in number only to the particles of dirt on the tip of my fingernail
die among humans and are reborn among humans
upon reading this chapter called repeating like a wheel the two boys asked mahamaudgalyayana
noble one will we too die among gods and humans only to be reborn among hell realm beings animals and spirits
gentlemen so long as the continuum of disturbing emotions remains uninterrupted you must spin like a waterwheel through the cycle of five migrations
disheartened they spoke this verse
being a god who cannot stay a god is no good being a human whose life is short is no good
being in samsara where there is no peace is no good that is why said the sugata nirvana is supreme
noble one henceforth come what may as we cycle through samsara we must avoid engaging with such disturbing emotions so please we ask that you teach us the dharma
mahamaudgalyayana knew their thoughts their tendencies their characters and their natures
drawing on all he had heard he taught them the dharma so that they abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship
becoming arhats free of attachment to the three realms for whom filth was equal to gold
who knew space like the palm of their hands whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood
whose knowledge had rent open the shell they attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdom
they turned their backs on worldly gain desires and esteem and were revered honored and praised by indra and the gods who attend him
when the monks saw the two novices miraculously flying through the air picking flowers they asked one another
venerables who are those two one said they are the two novices kin to ananda
our begging bowls are black with wear
our teeth are falling out and our hair turns grey and yet we have not achieved even stillness of mind
venerable if these two were but seven years old when they went forth
and yet abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship
then the blessed one spoke well when he said ananda awakening is attained through diligence
in doubt the monks went to he who severs all doubts the blessed buddha and asked
reverend what actions have these two novices done that the fruition of such an act should lead them to go forth at the mere age of seven
and that the blessed one exempted them alone from the vinaya guidelines he laid down for his disciples
allowing them to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
the blessed one responded
monks these two themselves performed the actionswhich have accrued a heap of karma whose results have matured
which follow their course like an irrigation channel which inevitably come to be
o who else will experience the actions they theselves have performed and accrued
monks actions which have been performed and accrued do not ripen upon the external elements
they do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons
likewise virtuous and nonvirtuous actions which have been performed and accrued come to fruition upon the aggregates elements
and seats of the senses of the one who performed them for
when the time and the conditions are right they alight upon embodied beings
monks earlier in this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings lasted twenty thousand years there appeared in the world
a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha
a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata one who knew the world
an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
the blessed buddha kasyapa
with his following of twenty thousand monks he lived and stayed in the deer park of rsipatana near varanasi
in varanasi there lived two householders and friends who had wished to go forth in their youth
but had not received leave to go forth from their relatives
at a certain point after their youth had faded they abdicated in favor of their relatives and went forth into the teachings of the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
as was natural given their junior status they were always expected to perform errands
and so the monks would order them about saying
you two retired devotees go do this
though they lived the holy life for the remainder of their lives
they did not achieve any of the host of qualities so later as they died they said this prayer
thus when the one became angry the other would say retired devotee if you couldnt go forth when you were young why get angry now
and you two retired devotees bring me thatone of them had a placid nature but the other was quicktempered
we have lived the holy life for what remained of our lives under the blessed one the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha the hallowed and unsurpassed kasyapa
but we have achieved none of the host of qualities
in the future when the lifespans of beings last one hundred years
therefore may the roots of virtue from having lived the holy life for what remained of our lives ensure that at the mere age of seven we go forth into the teachings of the blessed buddha sakyamuni
will become the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha
he knowledgeable and venerable one the sugata the one who knows the world
he unsurpassed guide who tames beings the teacher to gods and men the blessed buddha sakyamuni
monks the two householders of that time are now these two novices
and due to the prayer that they made they have gone forth at the mere age of seven
and i have exempted them alone from the vinaya guidelines i laid down for my disciples
allowing them to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
while the blessed buddha was journeying and passing through kasi he arrived at a place and smiled
as is natural
when blessed buddhas smile blue yellow red white maroon crystalline and silvery rays of light emerge from their mouths some streaming downwards and some streaming upwards
those that streamed downwards proceeded to the hell realms of sanjiva
kalasutra sanghata raurava maharaurava tapana pratapana avici arbuda
homage to he who severed the bonds destroyed the whole host of tirthikas vanquished the armies of mara and thus discovered this awakening
padma and mahapadma
alighting on and cooling those in the hot hells and alighting on and
warming those in the cold hells
to engender faith in them the blessed one sent an emanation which
when they saw it prompted them to think
gentlemen we have not died and moved on nor have we been born elsewhere
rather the various harms inflicted on us have been interrupted by a being we have never seen before
through the faith they felt in the emanation
the karma that led them to experience the hell realms was exhausted and they took rebirth as gods or humans forms in which they became fit vessels for the truth
trayastrimsa yama tusita
nirmanarati paranirmitavasavartina brahmakayika
brahmapurohita mahabrahman parittabha apramanabha
abhasvara parittasubha apramanasubha subhakrtsna
anabhraka punyaprasava brhatphala abrha
atapa sudrsa sudarsana and akanistha
those rays of light that streamed upwards reached the gods of
resonating with the words impermanence subject to suffering empty and selfless
caturmaharajika
the rays of light proclaimed these two verses
take action go forth apply yourself to the buddhas teachings
as an elephant does a mud hovel destroy yamas minions
he who with great care trains in the dharma and vinaya
abandons the cycle of rebirth and ends suffering once and for all
the rays of light then unfurled through the worlds of the great billionfold universe
so that they would in the future be drawn into the blessed ones sphere
if the blessed one was about to foretell actions of the past the rays of light would fade into the space behind the blessed one
if the blessed one was about to foretell actions of the future the rays of light would fade into the space before the blessed one
if the blessed one was about to foretell rebirth as a hell realm being the rays of light would fade into the soles of his feet
if the blessed one was about to foretell rebirth as an animal the rays of light would fade into his ankle
if the blessed one was about to foretell rebirth as a spirit the rays of light would fade into his big toe
if the blessed one was about to foretell rebirth as a human the rays of light would fade into his knee
if the blessed one was about to foretell a reign as a powerful king of the world the rays of light would fade into the palm of his left hand
if the blessed one was about to foretell a reign as a king of the world the rays of light would fade into the palm of his right hand
if the blessed one was about to foretell rebirth as a god the rays of light would fade into his navel
if the blessed one was about to foretell a sravakas awakening the rays of light would fade into his mouth
if the blessed one was about to foretell a pratyekabuddhas awakening the rays of light would fade into the tuft of hair at his brow
if the blessed one was about to foretell unsurpassed complete and perfect awakening the rays of light would fade into the usnisa at his crown
the rays of light then circled the blessed one three times and faded into the soles of his feet
the venerable ananda then pressed his palms together and said to the blessed one
reverend not without cause or condition do tathagatas arhats perfectly awakened buddhas smile
if so reverend what then has caused you to smile
what condition has occasioned it and then he asked again in verse
a mass made brilliant by a thousand colors emerged from your mouth
illuminating every direction so why bother with a parasol
not brazen nor dejected nor selfsatisfied you have become a buddha the best of beings
a victorious tamer of enemies not without cause do you flash a smile white like a conch or lotus root
your mind thus knows when the time is right to proclaim supreme sage master of spiritual practitioners
for your disciples who doubt dispel their uncertainty with words reliable sublime and virtuous
steady as a mountain or the salty sea lord buddhas do not smile accidentally
steady as you are this group is eager to hear the reason for your smile
the blessed one replied ananda it is like this
not without cause or condition do tathagatas arhats perfectly awakened buddhas smile ananda
a great many sinister men here have violated a great many nuns by bodily forcing themselves upon them
for this when they die they will pass from this life to be reborn among the denizens of hell
a monk then went to where the blessed one was pressed his palms together and bowed appealing to him in these words
reverend i am one of the many sinister men who have bodily and forcibly violated nuns
fool have you really committed this act
reverend indeed i have
the blessed one then decreed to the monks
monks a person who has violated a nun is one who will not flourish in the dharma and the vinaya
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
you should ask you have not violated a nun have you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when a householder of sravasti came to the jetavana
when monks are not free from desire it leads to transgressions requiring sangha intervention
some incur transgressions in their youth and then grow old
and others incur transgressions in their maturity
when such a transgression occurs the monks who retain the sutras
retain the vinaya and retain the matrka impose in accord with the dharma a sentence on the offender
the offender must serve the sangha while undergoing his full demotion or probation
according to some this service includes providing the sangha with drinks according to others it includes fanning them
at a certain point the householder from sravasti
saw a spread of fine shelters with choice food laid out for the community and thought
though there is some good to their teaching
there are faults too
when the group of six heard him say this they asked
what did you say householder
noble ones though there is some good to your teaching you too have faults
householder what are our faults
noble ones he replied you lack honor and respect for the elders by putting them to work
therefore monks i would exclude from this dharma and the vinaya those persons who have violated a nun
they lack honor and respect for those elders they put to work
there is a reason we put even elders to work
noble ones if i were to go forth would you put me to work too
they replied what would you say if someone much more distinguished than you were to go forth and we put even him to work
the householder thought if i were to go forth they would also put me to work
i must find some way around it
as the householder was possessed of a natural intelligence while in the monks company he learned how to conduct himself
having learned that he set off for a remote land
where he shaved off his hair and beard donned saffron robes and settled down
after a time monks who were paying homage to stupas passed by
when the pilgrims saw him they said
elder in sravasti there resides one who is verily a lord of dharma
around him gods are always appearing in the flesh
vast lights also appear divine sounds are heard
as are the auguries of allknowing beings and the two forms of wealthmaterial wealth and the wealth of dharmaare to be had
why then do you not go to sravasti
venerables i shall remain right here
they implored him again and again
at the urging of his brethren he set off for sravasti
in time he saw the spread of fine shelters with choice food laid out for the community there and thought
if i sit in the front row ill be called upon to demonstrate my knowledge
passing by the first seat he sat down on the second
when the allknowing kaundinya arrived he thought
if the blessed one declared that i am first among those who wear the monks mantle standard then who is this
on thinking it over kaundinya saw that he was an impostor and dismissed him with a snap of his fingers
and all the eldest of elder monks then also dismissed him with the snap of their fingers
subahu the venerable sariputra the venerable mahamaudgalyayana
the venerable asvajit bhadrika vaspa mahanaman yasas purna vimala gavampati
some time later he approached the group of six and they asked him
elder how many years have you passed
if youre asking my age i have seen sixty years he replied
they asked if the blessed one himself has not passed sixty years how could you
and they asked him retired devotee who is your preceptor
he replied who is the ascetic gautamas preceptor
they exclaimed venerables this retired devotee claims he has taken up these signifiers on his own
with this they grabbed him by his arms and legs dragged him before the senior monks and said
reverend sangha please listen
if the blessed one was the first selfordained one in this world this retired devotee is the second
or so he claims and with that they dismissed him from the senior monks presence
the blessed one then addressed the monks
monks this impostor is one who will not flourish in the dharma and the vinaya
therefore i would exclude impostors from this dharma and vinaya
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you ask him you are not an impostor are you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
venerable upali asked the blessed one
reverend if the blessed one says an impostor should be excluded
then reverend what constitutes an impostor
upali anyone who has participated in the purification two or three times with sound monks is thereby an impostor
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when a brahmin living in sravasti took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all of their desires
the wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all of his desires soon conceived a child
after eight or nine months
a pandaka child was born who though resembling a boy was neither female nor male still they nurtured and raised the child until it grew up
while the child was playing with a group of children he showed them his sex organs at which point they asked him
what are you he replied im a hermaphrodite
youre a brahmin they said
its not right to bring ill repute upon your family so do not behave like this
they said to his parents
you must stop this hermaphrodite of yours from behaving like this
his parents then said to him
hermaphrodite we are brahmins
though this put a stop to that the hermaphrodite did not linger
it is not right to bring ill repute upon our family do not behave so
he went to jetavana and after some time
he saw a group of young monks and thought
if i were to go forth
they could play the role of a male for me while i could play the role of a female for them
he then approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
have your parents given you their permission asked the monk
they have not
go and ask your parents
he went to his parents and said
father mother i seek to go forth
depressed the two of them thought
his going forth will require our parting with him
then they said to him hermaphrodite we give you our permission
he went to the monk and said noble one my parents have given me permission so please allow my going forth
after his going forth was allowed and he was granted ordination
he exposed his sex organs in the presence of monks whereupon they asked him
what are you a hermaphrodite
when he acknowledged that he was the monks appealed to the blessed one
and the blessed one said to the monks
a pandaka is one who will not flourish in the dharma and vinaya therefore
i would exclude pandakas from this dharma and vinaya
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
ask him you are not a pandaka are you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
monks there are five kinds of pandaka what are they
congenital hermaphrodites sequential hermaphrodites fetishists voyeurs and those who are sexually impaired
what is a congenital hermaphrodite one who is born neither a female nor a male
what is a sequential hermaphrodite someone who is female for half the month yet becomes male during the other half
what is a fetishist one who becomes erect if embraced by another
what is a voyeur one who becomes erect at the sight of others exertion
what is a person who is sexually impaired one whose sex organ has been rendered impotent by disease or one who has been castrated
if the first four types of pandakacongenital hermaphrodites sequential hermaphrodites fetishists and voyeurs
have not gone forth you should not allow their going forth
if they have gone forth they should be expelled
as for pandaka who are sexually impaired if they
while the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
the nagas thrice felt fiery sand fall from the heavens upon them
reducing their bodies to mere skeletons
after fiery sand thrice fell from the heavens upon a young naga
reducing his body to that of a mere skeleton he asked his mother
mother how long must i endure such suffering
son for as long as you are in this life
through all of this fiery sand had not fallen on other nagas who possessed miraculous powers and great might prompting him to ask
mother why did it not fall upon them
his mother replied it did not fall upon them because they possess miraculous powers and great might
they live for eons and they sustain the earth
even the garuda suparni could not dislodge them
through all of this fiery sand had not fallen on a number of scrawny nagas either prompting him to ask
mother why did it not fall upon those of their type
it did not fall upon them because they took refuge and adopted the precepts in the presence of the blessed one
if that is so then i too shall take refuge and adopt the precepts in the presence of the blessed one
son a single lifes suffering is easy to bear that of many lifetimes is not
if you take refuge and adopt the precepts in the presence of the blessed one
but then do not properly heed them
you will have to endure suffering as a denizen in the hell realms for a long time to come
the young naga thought what suffering could be worse than my present suffering
i shall take refuge and adopt the precepts in the presence of the blessed one
conjuring up the appearance of a brahmin he set off for jetavana
where he saw monks applying themselves to and abiding in meditation recitation yoga and concentration
upon seeing them he felt faith and thought
oh my should i first take refuge and adopt the precepts or go forth
on thinking it over he decided i shall go forth
and with that he approached a monk and said noble one i seek to go forth
as i am new you should go to someone else an elder
noble one i do not know anyone else
this is my first time in the presence of a noble being so i ask you please introduce me to a monk
as the new monks preceptor was a hermit living in the forest the monk took the naga disguised as a brahmin to see him and said
preceptor as this noble son seeks to go forth i ask that you allow him to go forth
the preceptor replied my dear sir the blessed one
said monks one could accept being pressed into work as a butcher but it is not right to leave the life once you have gone forth and been ordained
this brahmin would go to the hells
i too would fall so i will not ordain him
please preceptor the monk replied all you need do is allow his going forth and i shall undertake to train and instruct him
after the preceptor had allowed the nagas going forth and ordained him the preceptor said to the monk
my dear sir you and he now share a preceptor
as his instructor you must quiz him you must instruct him
and you must train him
the monk recited the ekottarikagama and then had the naga repeat it
as he did so with great vigor it took on the cadence of a prayer
the monk instructors eyes lit up with joy and the monk said to the naga disguised as a brahmin
my dear sir shall we seek alms together or on our own
the naga disguised as a brahmin thought i cannot live on the things humans eat
i had better return to the land of nagas where i can imbibe ambrosia and return once ive eaten
instructor let us seek them on our own
very well my dear sir replied the monk the naga would drink the ambrosia of the gods in the land of nagas and then return
as nagas require a lot of sleep he would soon fall into slumber
the monk would return later from his alms round as the naga was rising from his nap
one day the monk received alms right away took them and headed home
as he drew near he heard a sound like a smith pumping his bellows coming from his hut
looking through the keyhole he saw the entire hut filled with the coiled up body of a naga
and cried out a trickster a shapeshifter understanding well what such words meant
the naga hastily transformed cloaking his natural appearance and reverting to his conjured look
monks gathered around and asked him what is the matter
hes a shapeshifter the monk replied
they said this venerable applies himself diligently always making an effort in his recitations
why do you begrudge him
i do not begrudge him in the least it is just that hes a shapeshifter
while they were conferring the blessed one passed by and inquired
what is the matter
blessed one hes a shapeshifter
the blessed one replied a shapeshifter is one who will not flourish in the dharma and vinaya therefore
i would exclude shapeshifters from this dharma and vinaya
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
ask him you are not a shapeshifter are you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
monks a nagas nature is characterized by five things the rest are emanations
what are these five
nagas are born a natural birth they die a natural death they sleep a natural sleep
they are nourished naturally and they procreate naturallythese are the qualities they exhibit
the blessed one said to the naga my dear sir with this body of yours you cannot attain any of a host of qualities
so leave and do no harm to the monks
the naga not knowing where he might wind up eventually came upon a forest of sala trees where he conjured up a monastery with a high gate
skylights and latticed windows it was adorned with balustrades
beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye
with a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds seats and supplies
to visiting monks and wanderer monks he provided all the supplies they needed
after passing the rainy season at the monastery a retired devotee left for sravasti
where as was their wont the group of six disciples thought
here it is we who teach the dharma to the brahmins and householders that come and assemble
it is we who trounce our adversaries and it is we who spread the fame of our order
when he saw approaching off in the distance a retired devotee with a head as white as an agati flower and drooping eyebrows
as the group of six did whatever their selfappointed duties called for
they would never leave the gate into jetavana unattended
upananda rose early one morning cast aside his toothbrush donned his orange ceremonial robe and took up his post at the gate into jetavana
upananda thought no doubt this is one of our elder monks
going out to greet him he said welcome elder welcome
homage to you instructor replied the retired devotee
upananda thought my why i dont recognize this retired devotee as one of our instructors
nor do i recognize him as one of our preceptors
upananda then asked him retired devotee where have you come from
from the sala forest
why is there a monastery there
indeed i have there is a monastery in the sala forest
have you heard some news
said to the group of six we venerables must put off our other business for a time
so upananda went to the assembly hall and
as was their wont when one among the group of six heard the slightest news they all gathered in the afternoon to discuss it
it is a monastery whats there
a monk caretaker lives there
and provides visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they need
but if it lacks all the trappings it is poor
if it is fully outfitted it is a monastery
what is it like how is it poor
yes there is what type is it oh it is but a poor one
whats there a monk caretaker lives there
and provides visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they need
come let us pay a visit
the expelled naga who was now disguised as an elderly monk caretaker saw the six approaching from off in the distance
and thought so those rogues have come here
how would they treat me if i were to provide them with all the supplies they need
with that thought he allocated in order of seniority canopied beds and terraced cottages and provided them with all the supplies they needed
a few days after they had settled in they said
nanda and upananda this retired devotee has no obvious source of income nor any obvious record of allocations
we should make him account for what is here
they said to him retired devotee you have no obvious source of income
nor any obvious record of allocations come and account for them
noble ones he replied are you merely displeased or utterly disappointed
we are not just merely displeased
retired devotee we order you to comply
the group declared nanda and upananda record whatever supplies this retired devotee receives over the next seven days
how about seven days
thats impracticable how about seven months still impracticable
how about seven years
retired devotee in twelve years even the doors of this temple will have collapsed
elders i will comply how long must i keep records twelve years
the group of six passed the rainy season at that very monastery and yet they know nothing of its income and know nothing of its allocations
for our brethren would denounce us if it were said
the naga disguised as the retired devotee thought i shall make this monastery disappear once the sevenday period is up
when the group of six saw this they said
to some undershirts to some begging bowls and to some small plates
to some of the poorer brethren the naga proceeded to offer ceremonial robes to some upper robes to some lower robes
nanda and upananda investigate this retired devotee and after seven days evict him along with his partisans
the group of six who awoke from their sleep on a piece of dry ground said
after seven days had passed the retired devotee made the monastery vanish as the group of six slept and fled to the seashore
nanda and upananda get up and fetch some chalk so we may check the accounts
when they noticed they had been sleeping on a piece of dry ground they realized
the blessed one replied
when the monks asked the blessed one who was this being a god a naga a yaksa
causing him to flee and make his monastery disappear
we have opposed one who trusted in the blessed one and served the buddha dharma and sangha
that monk caretaker was a shapeshifter and yet this was so
if the group of six had not opposed him he would have served the buddha dharma and sangha for as long as the teachings remained
the blessed one reflected
all those shortcomings ensue from the monks forcing him to account for the monasterys income and allocations that had no obvious source or recipient
the blessed one then decreed a monk should not be forced to account for income and allocations with no obvious source and recipients
a monk should not be forced to account for those items for which the receipt is evident but its allocation is obscure
upananda thought my i dont recognize this retired devotee as one of our instructors nor do i recognize him as one of our preceptors
upananda thought no doubt this is one of our elder monks going out to greet him
he said welcome elder welcome homage to you instructor
when he saw approaching off in the distance a retired devotee with a head as white as an agati flower and drooping eyebrows
as the group of six did whatever their selfappointed duties called for they would never leave the gate into jetavana unattended
one day upananda rose early in the morning cast aside his toothbrush donned his orange mantle and took up his post at the gate into jetavana
a monk should not be forced to account for those items of which the allocation is evident but its receipt is obscure
a monk should mindfully and attentively monitor those items of which both the receipt and its allocation are evident
here it is we who teach the dharma to the brahmins and householders who come and assemble it is we who trounce our adversaries and it is we who spread the fame of our order
as was their wont the group of six thought
after passing the rainy season at the monastery a retired devotee left for sravasti
after hearing the dharma they provided visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they needed
ocean nagas in the guise of brahmins and householders gathered there and listened to the shapeshifting naga teach the dharma
after his encounter with the group of six the shapeshifting naga fled to the seashore
where he conjured up a second monastery with a high gate skylights and latticed windows it too was adorned with balustrades beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye with a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds seats and supplies
upananda then said to him retired devotee where have come from
ive come from the seashore
why is there a monastery there
yes there is he replied
what type is it oh it is but a poor one
what is the monastery like how is it poor
if it is fully outfitted it is a monastery but if it lacks all the trappings it is poor
it is a monastery whats there
a monk preacher lives there where he teaches the dharma to brahmins and householders
after hearing the dharma they provide visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they need
as was their wont when one among the group of six heard the slightest news they all gathered in the afternoon to discuss it
so upananda went to the assembly hall and said to the group of six
we venerables must put off our other business for a time
have you heard some news indeed i have upananda replied
there is a monastery on the seashore whats there
upon hearing the dharma from him they provide visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they need
come let us pay a visit
the debarred naga now disguised as a monk preacher saw the six approaching from off in the distance
and thought ah those rogues have arrived
what would they do if i refused to demurely acquiesce to them
the ocean nagas in the guise of brahmins and householders then gathered there and he taught them the dharma
after hearing the dharma they provided the visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they needed
at which point the group of six said nanda and upananda what does this retired devotee know
the ekottarikagama
if these monks here are all versed in the three pitakas are teachers of dharma in their own right and possessed of intelligence and untrammeled confidence why does he a savant who can only teach the ekottarikagama not request teachings from them
they said to the naga disguised as the monk preacher what do you know retired devotee
you are a savant who only teaches the ekottarikagama while
these monks here are all versed in the three pitakas are teachers of dharma in their own right and possessed of intelligence and untrammeled confidence
why do you not request teachings from them
what nobles ones do i stop them why do you not teach the dharma
nanda and upananda this retired devotee is at odds with us we will act to evict him
thinking if they move to evict me i wont find a place among the nagas either
then while the group of six were sleeping the naga made the monastery vanish and slipped into the ocean
on waking on the sandy beach the group of six said
nanda and upananda get up and erect a lion throne from which we shall teach the dharma
when they noticed they had slept on a sandy beach they said
we opposed one who trusted in the blessed one and served the buddha dharma and sangha causing him to flee and make his monastery disappear
when the monks asked the blessed one who was this being a god a naga a yaksa
he blessed one replied that monk preacher was a shapeshifter and yet this was so
if the group of six monks had not opposed him he would have served the buddha dharma and sangha for as long as the teachings remained
the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from the monks teaching without being requested to do so
with that he said a monk should not teach without first having been asked to do so
if a monk teaches without first having been asked to do so a serious breach occurs
if he is invited to do so then no transgression ensues
buddharaksita a wealthy householder with much riches and goods who lived in sravasti
took a wife of equal caste and together they sported made love and indulged all of their desires
looking to guide them the venerable sariputra went to their house and
enjoined the householder and his wife to seek refuge and pledge to uphold the precepts
some time afterwards the householders wife conceived a child
knowing this being was certain to become one of the fortunate the venerable sariputra
visited the family without any ascetic attendants in his wake prostrating at his feet the householder asked
does the noble one have no ascetic attendants
householder i accept
after eight or nine months had passed a boy was born well proportioned pleasing to the eye
if she should give birth to a boy i will offer him as an ascetic attendant to the noble one
noble one my spouse has conceived a child
its those who issue from people like you who become my ascetic attendants
householder he replied do you think my ascetic attendants simply sprout up like weeds
handsome radiant with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasol
long arms a broad forehead eyebrows that meet and a prominent nose
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered
to celebrate his birth in grand style during which time they discussed what name should be chosen for the boy
some said since the boy is buddharaksitas son the boy should be named sangharaksita and thus he was named sangharaksita
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods the boy sangharaksita grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
on the very day sangharaksita was born that same day sons were also born to five hundred merchants
each of whom was given a name appropriate to his patrilineage
in time the boy sangharaksita grew up and the venerable sariputra knew it was time to allow his going forth
the householder buddharaksita then said to sangharaksita
as he sat sariputra signaled to prompt the householder buddharaksita
after prostrating at sariputras feet the householder buddharaksita laid out a seat and invited the venerable sariputra to sit
so looking to guide them he went alone without any ascetic attendants in his wake to the boys house
son when you were in your mothers womb before you were even born
i offered you as an ascetic attendant to the noble sariputra go and serve him
as this was to be sangharaksitas last life as a sentient being a smile had already spread across his face and
without apprehension neither crestfallen nor gloomy he pledged to do as he was told
with that he became the venerable sariputras attendant apprentice and follower
after the venerable sariputra had allowed his going forth and given him ordination
he taught sangharaksita how dharma practitioners conduct themselves and made him recite the four agamas
some time later
after assembling merchandise to bring on their journey across the ocean the five hundred sons of the five hundred merchants conferred and decided to bring along with their goods a noble monk across the ocean
gentlemen the ocean is full of many terrors
so those of us that journey across the ocean would do well to ask for the company of a noble one who might teach us the dharma
beginning their search they asked who shall we ask to come
gentlemen we should ask our peer the noble sangharaksita for we grew up together playing in the dirt with him
some answered
they went to him prostrated at his feet and said
so if we set out upon the ocean an ocean full of many terrors
noble sangharaksita we grew up together playing in the dirt with you our peer
we would do well were the noble one to teach dharma to those of us crossing the ocean
therefore noble one we ask that you come with us across the ocean
gentlemen he replied as i am not at liberty to do as i please you should put your request to my preceptor
they went to the venerable sariputra bowed their heads at his feet and said
noble sariputra please give us your attention
we grew up together playing in the dirt with our peer the noble sangharaksita
an ocean full of many terrors
we would do well were the noble one to teach dharma to those of us crossing the ocean
for that reason we ask that you send the noble sangharaksita with us across the ocean
ask the blessed one himself and i will not object
they went to the blessed one bowed their heads at his feet and said
blessed one please give us your attention
we grew up together playing in the dirt with our peer the noble sangharaksita
so if we set out upon the ocean
the blessed one considered whether or not these merchants had any meager roots of virtue and saw that they did
considering who their awakening hinged on he saw that it hinged on the monk sangharaksita
the blessed one then said to the venerable sangharaksita
sangharaksita you shall go on this journey across the ocean and face your fears along with what provokes them
with his silence the venerable sangharaksita assented to the blessed one
after performing rites for protection good luck and success the five hundred merchants together with the venerable sangharaksita
carried their goods to the ocean in carts on poles in baskets and hampers and on camels bullocks and donkeys
setting out for the ocean they passed in stages through villages towns countryside kingdoms and markets until they reached the ocean shore
where they paused to recover from the weariness of the road
after calling out three times they set out upon the ocean in pursuit of riches
part of the way into their voyage they and their seafaring ship were held up by nagas
for five hundred denarii they obtained a ship and hired five hundred crew members to serve as stewards cleaning staff divers deck hands and riggers
the merchants began to implore siva varuna kubera sakra brahma and other gods
whoever it is that dwells here be they gods nagas yaksas or gandharvas may they tell us what they desire
from the ocean there came a voice saying give us the noble sangharaksita
the blessed one and the venerable sariputra have entrusted you to us
so we would sooner die and face our death with you than turn you over
noble one you are our peer we grew up together playing in the dirt with you
why do you not give me over
noble one they replied a voice from the ocean has said give us the noble sangharaksita
the venerable sangharaksita said to them what are you talking about gentlemen
the blessed one and the venerable sariputra have entrusted him to us
so we would sooner die and face our death with him than turn him over
the noble sangharaksita is our peer we grew up together playing in the dirt with him
the venerable sangharaksita thought
this must be what the blessed one meant when he said to me sangharaksita you shall go on this journey across the ocean and face your fears along with what provokes them
taking up his begging bowl and dharma robe he prepared to jump into the sea seeing him prepare to jump
the merchants shouted noble sangharaksita what are you doing what are you doing
as they tried to stop him sangharaksita jumped into the sea
and at the very moment he did so the nagas released the ship
taking the venerable sangharaksita the nagas returned to the land of the nagas
noble sangharaksita this shall be the sanctuary of the perfectly awakened buddha vipasyin while these shall be the sanctuaries of the perfectly awakened buddhas sikhin visvabhu krakucchanda kanakamuni and kasyapa
this shall be the sanctuary of the blessed one sakyamuni
after prostrating to the shrines with them sangharaksita sat on the seat they had arranged at the center of the assembled nagas
the nagas joined their palms and supplicated him
noble sangharaksita though the blessed ones sutras
and matrka have taken root among gods and humans we nagas were born into this cursed state with fallen forms
o noble one please see that the ultimate sutras take root among us
sangharaksita assented with the words i shall do just that
smiling at one another the nagas and their naga women
watched in amazement as they invited the venerable sangharaksita to pay homage to a set of shrines saying
the shapeshifter who had fled his seaside monastery for the land of the nagas after being confronted by the group of six then chose three naga youths and said to the first
you shall memorize the samyuktagama
to the second he said you shall memorize the madhyamagama
to the third he said you shall memorize the dirghagama
the nagas can learn how to recite the ekottarikagama by listening to me recite it
when the young nagas began to recite
the first closed his eyes as he sought to memorize the samyuktagama
the second turned his back as he sought to memorize the madhyamagama
while the third sat off in the distance as he sought to memorize the dirghagama
because the shapeshifter had greater exposure to buddhist customs than the others he was respectful deferential
and came first to all of their chores he would rise early and say
noble ones get up and brush your teeth
pay homage to the gathering of blessed ones and their shrines
noble one the shapeshifter asked what are their failings
they lack respect and deference the first closes his eyes as he seeks to memorize the samyuktagama
the second turns his back as he seeks to memorize the madhyamagama
while the third sits off in the distance as he seeks to memorize the dirghagama
you alone are respectful deferential and come first to all of your chores
noble one the shapeshifter replied it is not that they lack respect and deference
the one who closes his eyes as he seeks to memorize the samyuktagama has noxious eyes that burn
the one who turns his back as he seeks to memorize the madhyamagama has noxious breath
and the one who sits off in the distanceas he seeks to memorize the dirghagama has a noxious touch
sangharaksita replied even if with their good memories they remember them they still have certain faults
noble one if naga youths recite the agamas will they remember them or not
eat and make the bed once as they were all reciting their respective agamas the shapeshifter said
i myself have noxious fangs
frightened the venerable sangharaksita thought
look i am living among my mortal enemies
and he grew pallid emaciated feeble withered thin and weak
the shapeshifting naga asked noble one why have you become pallid emaciated feeble withered thin and weak
i am among enemies so the moment i do anything to upset you i shall be reduced to naught but a memory
we do not intend to harm the noble one
however given the situation does the noble one wish to return to jambudvipa
my dear sir i do i do not care for this place
the nagas discussed the matter amongst themselves
and when the noble sangharaksitas ship passed by on its return journey they raised him from the waters and placed him onboard the ship
smiles broke out upon the merchants faces as they stared in amazement and cried out
welcome back noble sangharaksita welcome back
sangharaksita said gentlemen
rejoice for i have seen to it that the four agamas have taken root in the land of nagas
noble one we do we rejoice in this good you have done for others for this is the job of those who go forth
reunited and happy the merchants and the venerable sangharaksita completed the journey back to shore
on arriving all were tired and weary as his companions slept the venerable sangharaksita turned his gaze to the ocean
the blessed one has said monks there are five things one never tires of looking at and which are in no way displeasing to the eye
what are the five
sumeru the king of mountains and a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha
a clever and youthful elephant a king of the world the ocean with its monsters
one never tires of looking at
and which are in no way displeasing to the eye
these five things are in no way displeasing to the eye
gentlemen it is not good that we have left the noble sangharaksita behind we must turn around
but then on reflection it occurred to them the noble sangharaksita possesses miraculous powers and great might
if he did not meet his end in the ocean how could he meet his end while traveling on dry land
with his miraculous powers and great might he must have gone far ahead of us and be waiting there now
with the call gentlemen come let us go they set out
after searching everywhere to no avail they gave up dispirited and downcast they said
sangharaksita sees the effects of actions with his own eyes
sangharaksita gazed long at the ocean until just before dawn when fatigued he was overcome by a deep sleep
not long after the merchants loaded the pack animals and set out
but because it was in the wee hours of the morning they could not see the venerable sangharaksita
and they began to look and ask one another gentlemen what has happened to the noble sangharaksita
some suggested he had gone ahead while others said he was still coming from behind and still others said he was traveling in the middle of the caravan
when the sun rose its rays struck the venerable sangharaksita as he lay asleep on the empty sandy beach waking him from his slumber
seeing no one around he thought what will i do if the merchants have left
they might have gone in any direction
with great courage the venerable sangharaksita set out but he could see no trail
after searching about he spied a narrow path and set off upon it
after a time he saw in a forest of sala trees a monastery with a high gate skylights and latticed windows
it was adorned with balustrades beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye
with a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds seats and supplies
it was surrounded by a variety of trees and graced with pools and ponds
when he saw the resident monks finely dressed and well trained
living peacefully in this glorious and heavenly abode he respectfully approached them
ringing with the sounds of swans cranes peacocks parrots mynahs and cuckoos
with a show of respect they said to him
welcome reverend sangharaksita welcome from where have you come just now
after he explained everything that had happened
they let him rest and once he recovered from the fatigue of the road they led him into the monastery
once there he saw that fine seats had been arranged and choice foods laid out they asked him
reverend sangharaksita are you not thirsty are you not hungry
as soon as they sat down the monastery vanished and each of their begging bowls turned into iron clubs of different sorts
venerables he replied i am thirsty and i am hungry
then partake reverend sangharaksita
i will eat with the sangha
reverend sangharaksita you are tired from your travels so eat now
later the food will have spoiled
seeing the fault in waiting sangharaksita ate and then took a seat off to one side
some time later the meal was laid out and
when the wooden beam was struck the monks filed in each carrying his own begging bowl
and sat down in order of seniority
reverend sangharaksita they replied the people of jambudvipa are skeptical so you will not believe us
why would i not believe what i have seen with my own eyes
reverend sangharaksita we were disciples of the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
while in the meal queue we fought and as the fruition of that karma have been born as denizens of an ephemeral hell
as soon as we die and pass from this life we will be reborn among the denizens of hell and will have to live there in such straits
reverend sangharaksita once you have returned to jambudvipa say to the brethren
the venerable sangharaksita approached them and asked
who are you venerables what karma has led you to this
venerables do not fight in the food queue like kasyapas monks
do not act so as to accrue the fortune for that mass of suffering
it would be good if you were you to explain our plight at length
after agreeing to do just that sangharaksita departed
after some time he saw again as before in a forest of sala trees a second monastery with a high gate skylights and latticed windows
it was adorned with balustrades beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye
with a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds seats and supplies
as soon as the mealtime ended the monastery reappeared as before while the monks also resumed their peaceful demeanors
for the remainder of the meal they bludgeoned each other over the head with their iron clubs
cracking their skulls open and inflicting unbearable pain that caused them to cry out pitifully
as soon as they sat down the monastery vanished and each of their begging bowls turned into iron clubs of different sorts
and perfectly outfitted with beds seats and supplies
it was surrounded by a variety of trees
and graced with pools and ponds ringing with the sounds of swans cranes peacocks parrots mynahs and cuckoos
with a show of respect they said to him welcome reverend sangharaksita welcome
he respectfully approached them
when he saw the resident monks finely dressed and well trained living peacefully in this glorious and heavenly abode
from where have you come just now
after he explained everything that had happened they let him rest and once he recovered from the fatigue of the road
they led him into the monastery
once there he saw that fine seats had been arranged and choice foods laid out
they asked him reverend sangharaksita are you not thirsty are you not hungry
venerables i am thirsty and i am hungry
then partake reverend sangharaksita
i will eat with the sangha
reverend sangharaksita you are fatigued from your travels so eat now
later the food will have spoiled
seeing the fault in waiting he ate and then took a seat off to one side
some time later the meal was laid out and when the wooden beam was struck the monks filed in each carrying his own begging bowl
and sat down in order of seniority
as soon as they sat down the monastery vanished and the food and drink turned into molten iron
for the remainder of the meal they doused one another in molten iron
scalding their bodies and inflicting unbearable pain that caused them to cry out pitifully
as soon as the mealtime ended the monastery reappeared as before while the monks also resumed their peaceful demeanors
the venerable sangharaksita approached them and asked
who are you venerables what karma has led you to this
reverend sangharaksita they replied the people of jambudvipa are skeptical so you will not believe us
why would i not believe what i have seen with my own eyes
reverend sangharaksita we were disciples of the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
once the sangha had received a supply of rich food and when a group of visiting monks turned up
those of us overcome by greed thought and even said we should not serve the food until the visiting monks have left
for seven days an unseasonable rain fell spoiling the food and drink leaving it unsuitable for consumption
thus we wasted what had been given in faith and as the fruition of that karma have been born as denizens of an ephemeral hell
as soon as we die and pass from this life we will be reborn among the denizens of a great hell and will have to live there in such straits
reverend sangharaksita once you have returned to jambudvipa say to the brethren venerables
do not waste what has been given in faith like kasyapas monks
do not act so as to accrue the fortune for that mass of suffering it would be well were you to explain our plight at length
after agreeing to do just that sangharaksita departed
after some time he saw again as before in a forest of sala trees a third monastery with a high gate skylights and latticed windows
it was adorned with balustrades beguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eye
with a show of respect they said to him welcome reverend sangharaksita welcome
from where have you just now come
after he explained everything that had happened they let him rest and once he recovered from the fatigue of the road
they led him into the monastery
once there he saw that fine seats had been arranged and choice foods laid out
they asked him reverend sangharaksita are you not thirsty are you not hungry
venerables i am thirsty and i am hungry
then partake reverend sangharaksita
i will eat with the sangha
reverend sangharaksita you are fatigued from your travels so eat now
later the food will have spoiled
seeing the fault in waiting he ate and then took a seat off to one side
some time later the meal was laid out and when the wooden beam was struck
the monks filed in each carrying his own begging bowl and sat down in order of seniority
as soon as they sat down the monastery caught alight burst into flames and was engulfed in a fire that began to burn as a single giant inferno
for the remainder of the meal the fire raged
burning their bodies and inflicting unbearable pain that caused them to cry out pitifully
as soon as the mealtime ended the monastery reappeared as before while the monks also resumed their peaceful demeanors
with a staircase to the upper level and perfectly outfitted with beds seats and supplies
it was surrounded by a variety of trees and graced with pools and ponds
ringing with the sounds of swans cranes peacocks parrots mynahs and cuckoos
when he saw the resident monks finely dressed and well trained living peacefully in this glorious and heavenly abode he respectfully approached them
the venerable sangharaksita approached them and asked
who are you venerables what karma has led you to this
reverend sangharaksita they replied the people of jambudvipa are skeptical so you will not believe us
why would i not believe what i have seen with my own eyes
reverend sangharaksita we were disciples of the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
in time our ethics became lax and we became dissolute
when the ethical monks evicted us from the monastery
we took up in an empty monastery
after a while an ethical monk happened by which gave us an idea
we thought he alone can purify patronage we must get him to stay and so he stayed
and in time as a result of that many ethical monks gathered there who then proceeded to evict us
those of us who could not bear this piled wood straw and dried dung and set fire to the monastery
burning many of the monks intent on training there
as the fruition of that karma we have been born as denizens of an ephemeral hell
as soon as we die and pass from this life we will be reborn among the denizens of hell and will have to live there in such straits
reverend sangharaksita once you have returned to jambudvipa say to the brethren
venerables do not nurse hatred for your brethren as kasyapas monks did
do not act so as to accrue the fortune for that mass of suffering it would be well were you to explain our plight at length
after agreeing to do just that sangharaksita departed
on his journey the venerable sangharaksita saw beings shaped like walls pillars trees leaves flowers fruit rope brooms bowls mortars and pestles pots and even beings cut at the waist their bodies held together by tendons
listen gentlemen these ascetic sons of the sakya tend to preach a great deal
let none of us offer a single word in response having made this pact they remained where they were
and began to confer with one another
the seers saw the venerable sangharaksita approaching from off in the distance
sangharaksitas sermon leads five hundred seers to the truth
eventually the venerable sangharaksita reached a settlement with an ashram where there lived five hundred seers
with a peaceful demeanor sangharaksita approached them but when he requested a place to stay
they gave not a word in response
a single seer intent on merit said
why do we not give you a place to stay it is because you have a fault
you tend to preach a lot you must therefore swear an oath
i will give you a place if you refrain from giving even the slightest sermon
seer as you instruct i shall not preach replied sangharaksita
the seer took sangharaksita to an unoccupied thatched hut in the settlement and told him he could sleep there
sangharaksita sprinkled water on swept and applied fresh cow dung to the dirt floor of the thatched hut
on seeing this the seers said gentlemen these ascetic sons of the sakya are sanitary
sangharaksita washed his feet outside the thatched hut before going back inside
sitting down he crossed his legs held his body erect and rested in mindfulness
a goddess living in the ashram went to the venerable sangharaksita during the evening watch
and said noble sangharaksita please teach the dharma
goddess i wish you well but did you not see i obtained this resting place by making a pact
would you like me to be kicked out the goddess thought
this renunciant is tired so i shall return during the night watch she returned during the night watch
sister you just cant leave it be you must want me to be kicked out
she thought this renunciant is still groggy from sleep i shall return during the final watch
she returned during the final watch and said noble sangharaksita why do you sleep
i woke you in the middle of the night and asked you to teach the dharma
sister you are trying by every means to get me kicked out
did the blessed one not say you must face your fears along with what provokes them
noble one the darkness of night has passed even if you were kicked out why would it matter youd be seeking to leave soon anyway
sister what you say is true i must get going regardless of whether i am kicked out
since these people are brahmins i should recite a verse the brahmins themselves take to be true
sangharaksita then began to recite the brahmanavarga
so long as doubt remains going naked with matted hair smeared in mud a motley diet
sleeping rough unwashed and smelly and never squatting do not make men pure
but he who forsakes violence toward all who live acts with virtue is pacific subdued and restrained
and aspires to purity even if he be bedecked in jewelry that is a brahmin an ascetic a monk
thus did i hear at one time
the blessed one was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
after that sangharaksita began to recite the nagaropama sutra
on hearing this verse the seers thought
this monks verses express the real meaning of brahmin
ne seer drew near then a second and a third until they all surrounded him
at which point the goddess charmed them so they could not see one another
the blessed one said to the monks
monks before i achieved perfect awakening and became a perfect buddha i went alone into the wild
while inwardly absorbed this perfect thought arose in my mind
ah this world is prone to suffering
for we are born we age we die we deteriorate and then it all happens again
and though a higher state exists beings who age and die know nothing of the perfect remedies that exist
i then pondered what was needed for birth to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of birth
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is becoming there will be birth and becoming contributes to the occurrence of birth
i then pondered what was needed for becoming to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of becoming
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is grasping there will be becoming and grasping contributes to the occurrence of becoming
i then pondered what was needed for contact to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of contact
i then pondered what was needed for sensation to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of sensation
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is contact there will be sensation and contact contributes to the occurrence of sensation
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is sensation there will be craving and sensation contributes to the occurrence of craving
i then pondered what was needed for craving to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of craving
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is craving there will be grasping and craving contributes to the occurrence of grasping
i then pondered what was needed for grasping to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of grasping
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there are seats for the six senses there will be contact and seats for the six senses contribute to the occurrence of contact
i then pondered what was needed for the seats of the six senses to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of the seats of the six senses
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there are name and form there will be seats for the six senses and name and form contribute to the occurrence of seats for the six senses
i then pondered what was needed for name and form to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of name and form
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is consciousness there will be name and form and consciousness contributes to the occurrence of name and form
i then pondered what was needed for consciousness to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of consciousness
by reversing the conception of i one will not incite what follows from that
thus consciousness contributes to name and form
name and form contribute to the seats of the six senses the seats of the six senses contribute to contact
contact contributes to sensation sensation contributes to craving
craving contributes to grasping grasping contributes to becoming
becoming contributes to birth birth contributes to aging and death
and the occurrence of sorrow lamentation suffering unhappiness and strife
and that is how i thought this whole huge mass of suffering comes to be
i then pondered what must be absent for aging and death not to occur and what must cease for aging and death to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no birth no aging and death will occur and the cessation of birth arrests aging and death
i then pondered what must be absent for birth not to occur and what must cease for birth to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no becoming no birth will occur and the cessation of becoming arrests birth
i then pondered what must be absent for becoming not to occur and what must cease for becoming to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no grasping no becoming will occur and the cessation of grasping arrests becoming
i then pondered what must be absent for grasping not to occur and what must cease for grasping to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no craving no grasping will occur and the cessation of craving arrests grasping
i then pondered what must be absent for craving not to occur and what must cease for craving to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no sensation no craving will occur and the cessation of sensation arrests craving
i then pondered what must be absent for the seats of the six senses not to occur and what must cease for the seats of the six senses to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there are no name and form no seats of the six senses will occur and the cessation of name and form arrests the seats of the six senses
i then pondered what must be absent for sensation not to occur and what must cease for sensation to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no contact no sensation will occur and the cessation of contact arrests sensation
i then pondered what must be absent for contact not to occur and what must cease for contact to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there are no seats for the six senses no contact will occur and the cessation of the seats for the six senses arrests contact
i then pondered what must be absent for name and form not to occur and what must cease for name and form to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no consciousness no name and form will occur and the cessation of consciousness arrests name and form
i then pondered what must be absent for consciousness not to occur and what must cease for consciousness to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no conditioning no consciousness will occur and the cessation of conditioning arrests consciousness
i then pondered what must be absent for conditioning not to occur and what must cease for conditioning to cease
on proper reflection i realized this perfectly and as it is if there is no ignorance no conditioning will occur and the cessation of ignorance arrests conditioning
thus the cessation of ignorance arrests conditioning the cessation of conditioning arrests consciousness
the cessation of consciousness arrests name and form the cessation of name and form arrests the seats of the six senses
the cessation of the seats of the six senses arrests contact the cessation of contact arrests sensation
the cessation of sensation arrests craving the cessation of craving arrests grasping
the cessation of grasping arrests becoming the cessation of becoming arrests birth
the cessation of birth arrests aging and death and sorrow lamentation suffering unhappiness and strife
and that is how i thought this whole huge mass of suffering comes to cease
monks i thought of this as an old path i had found an old route an old trail which seers of old have traveled and traversed
it is analogous to this say that a person wanders passing through a great forest
and discovers an old path an old route
an old trail which people of old have traveled and traversed and he follows it until he sees an old city and a kings delightful old palace
with its resplendent gardens resplendent groves resplendent pools and fine hedges
on seeing it he thinks i shall go and speak to the king
he goes to the king and says your majesty please grant me your attention
your majesty allow me to restore the city allow me to restore the kings palace
in time the kings palace prospers and thrives crops are bountiful and the land teems with animals and people
just so monks i too have found an old path an old route an old trail which seers of old have traveled and traversed
i saw an old city and the kings delightful old palace with its resplendent gardens resplendent groves resplendent pools and fine hedges
when i discovered an old path an old route an old trail which people of old have traveled and traversed and i followed it until
monks what is this old path this old route this old trail which seers of old have traveled and traversed
it is this the noble ones eightfold path
which consists of right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right recollection and right concentration
monks this is the old path the old route the old trail which seers of old have traveled and traversed
i reached it and on reaching it i saw aging and death
and i saw the origins of aging and death the cessation of aging and death and the path that leads to the cessation of aging and death
i saw birth becoming grasping craving sensation contact the seats of the six senses name and form consciousness and conditioning
and i saw the origins of conditioning the cessation of conditioning and the path that leads to the cessation of conditioning
and so having been perfectly awakened by my perception i proclaim it to an array of monks nuns
laymen laywomen tirthikas ascetics brahmins sadhus and wanderers
and when a monk perfectly accomplishes it he too becomes an accomplished adept sagacious righteous and an agent of virtue
and when a nun a layman or a laywoman perfectly accomplishes it
they too become accomplished adepts sagacious righteous and agents of virtue
of benefit to a great many beings prodigious and teaches widely and perfectly among gods and humans
thus it is that such a one who lives purely is magnanimous
sangharaksita closed his sermon with the dedication may all who live here gathered on the earth or in the sky be always kind to creatures and practice dharma night and day
all present realized the truths and in that moment achieved the fruit of a nonreturner and with it miraculous abilities
in one voice they cried out well said reverend sangharaksita well said
the goddess then released them from the miraculous spell they were under
so they came to see one another again
as they caught sight of one another they exclaimed
oh you too were here you were here i was here good
the seers had discovered a mighty state and having discovered it proclaimed
reverend sangharaksita if it is permitted we would obtain the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
we would live the holy life in the blessed ones presence
smiling sangharaksita said
venerables your great and dauntless selfconfidence is noble it is excellent it is excellent
it is excellent what is more the blessed one said five advantages rightly come only to the wise with perfect vision who aspire to going forth
what are those five
it is only the wise with perfect vision who aspire to going forth
about whom it may rightly be said
he will pursue his aim without diversion
i make offerings to and praise those who are slave agent or emissary to no one those who are independent and not in anyones service
he will attain the unsurpassed accomplishment and bliss of nirvana
even should he fail to attain the unsurpassed accomplishment and bliss of nirvana he will be reborn among gods
buddhas the saintly disciples of buddhas who have reached perfection and entered perfection and saintly beings praise renunciants in many ways
sangharaksita continued so you shall go forth but will you go forth before the blessed one or before me
before the blessed one the seers replied
in that case come let us go to the blessed one
reverend sangharaksita shall we travel under our own miraculous powers or under your miraculous powers
hearing this pained the venerable sangharaksita
who thought if they have attained such a store of qualities due to my influence it looks as if i am but a raft to them
dispirited he replied venerables i have a small task to perform so please wait here for a bit
and with that he sat down at the base of a tree his legs crossed his body erect and rested in mindfulness
the blessed one said there are five benefits to being well versed in the teachings what are they
one becomes knowledgeable about the aggregates knowledgeable about the constituents
knowledgeable about the seats of the senses knowledgeable about interdependent arising
and one need not rely on others for instructions or further teachings on them
thus by applying himself diligently sangharaksita came to understand samsaras everrevolving five cycles
it being by nature subject to degradation decline dispersal and destruction all of sangharaksitas conditioning was overwhelmed and he abandoned all disturbing emotions
he turned his back on worldly gain desires and esteem
and was revered honored and praised by indra and the gods who attend him
he attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdom
and whose knowledge had rent open the shell
whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood
for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand
for whom filth was equal to gold
my births have come to an end i have lived the holy life i have done what needed doing i will know no lives after this one
thus he became an arhat free of desire for the three realms
with his achievement he understood
he perceived that he had in that very life actualized the unsurpassed aim of the holy life
for which the sons of noble families with perfect faith cut their hair shave their beards don the saffron robes and go forth from home into homelessness
sangharaksita said to the seers gentlemen hold on to the corner of my robe and we shall travel under my miraculous powers
the seers grabbed hold of his robe
and the venerable sangharaksita like a swan spreading its wings flew with his miraculous powers up into the sky above
sangharaksita went to the blessed one
bowed his head at his feet and sat off to one side
there is no gift for the tathagata like these the gift of disciples
monks this monk sangharaksita comes with gifts for the tathagata
monks do you see sangharaksita coming from off in the distance we do reverend
though he saw them he asked the monks
from off in the distance the blessed one saw sangharaksita approaching with his gifts
who was seated in the midst of hundreds of monks teaching
sangharaksita then led the one thousand sons of noble families to the blessed one
sangharaksita descended and they secured their wares
the merchants replied noble sangharaksita we too will go forth so please alight and sit while we secure our wares
these five hundred sons of noble families seek monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma in the blessed ones presence so we are going to the blessed one
noble sangharaksita is that you welcome i have come where are you headed
the five hundred merchants were securing their wares when they saw sangharaksita and exclaimed
sangharaksita leads an entourage of one thousand to the buddha along the way
before requesting the blessed one
reverend these one thousand sons of noble families seek monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma
in the blessed ones presence i ask that the blessed one have compassion and allow their going forth
the venerable sangharaksita asked the blessed buddha
reverend i have seen beings shaped like walls pillars trees
i ask that he ordain them by saying to them come join me monks
the blessed one could allow their going forth so he said come monks join me in living the holy life
it was only after the blessed one had said this that their hair fell out and they were clothed in robes
with but a weeks worth of hair and beard alms bowl and water pitcher in hand
having completed their approach to monkhood they stood with the deportment of monks who had been ordained for one hundred years
as was said hair tonsured and body clad in robes from the tathagatas call to come forth that moment their senses were perfectly stilled
and their bodies garbed by the buddhas mind
the blessed one gave them instructions
to which they applied themselves with diligence effort and exertion
abandoning all disturbing emotions and actualizing arhatship
thus they became arhats free of desire for the three realms
for whom filth was equal to gold for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand
whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood
and whose knowledge had rent open the shell
they attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdom
they turned their backs on worldly gain desires
and esteem and were revered honored and praised by indra and the gods who attend him
leaves flowers fruit rope
brooms bowls mortars and pestles
an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata one who knew the world
sangharaksita in a time now passed during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years
the blessed buddha kasyapa appeared in the world
those beings you saw were his disciples when he lived and dwelt in the rsipatana deer park near varanasi
sangharaksita when those beings you saw who were shaped like walls were monks
they defaced a wall belonging to the sangha with their spit
sangharaksita replied the blessed one those being themselves performed the actions
and pots as well as beings cut at the waist their bodies held together by tendons
reverend what actions did they perform for it to ripen in such ways
when the time and the conditions are right they alight upon embodied beings
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons
fruition upon the aggregates elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them for
likewise virtuous and nonvirtuous actions which have been performed and accrued come to
sangharaksita actions which have been performed and accrued do not ripen upon the external elements
they do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
which have accrued a heap of karma whose results have matured which follow their course like an irrigation channel which inevitably come to be
so who else will experience the actions they themselves have performed and accrued
when those beings you saw who were shaped like pillars were monks
they defaced a pillar belonging to the sangha with their mucus as the fruition of that act they have come to resemble pillars
when those beings you saw who were shaped like trees leaves flowers and fruit were monks
they used trees leaves flowers and fruit belonging to the sangha for their own ends
as the fruition of that act they have come to resemble trees leaves flowers and fruit
when those beings you saw who were shaped like rope and brooms were monks they used rope and brooms belonging to the sangha for their own ends
the novices thought it would seem we are too late and left dispirited with expressions of resignation
as the fruition of that act those monks have come to resemble bowls
when those beings you saw who were shaped like mortars and pestles were monks
they were in charge of begging bowls and they said to an arhat novice who had at the time been appointed keeper of the seals
novice we have quite a bit of grain to grind in the mortar
they replied do you not see we are washing the bowls the drinks have already been drunk
seized by stinginess towards the novices
do novices get whatever drinks are provided to the sangha
when they were washing the bowls some visiting monks arrived and asked the monks
when those beings you saw who were shaped like bowls
were monks they were in charge of providing clean drinking water
as the fruition of that act they have come to resemble rope and brooms
the arhat novice replied elders im busy at the moment please wait a bit i shall give it to you later
feeling impatient the monks became enraged and said
novice if we wanted to use the mortar we could toss you into the mortar and grind you too
to say nothing of a bit of grain
the arhat novice thought they are enraged
if i respond to them it will only inflame their anger further
so he remained silent after a time their rage passed and when it did he went to them
and said elders do you know who i am
they replied yes we know you are but a novice who has gone forth for the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
we however are monks
elders though that is so since going forth i have done all that needed to be done
what is that i have abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship
while you are bound by all bonds i have been definitively freed from all bonds
as you have spoken harshly you must confess your wrongs as wrong
although the monks confessed their wrongs as wrong the actions came to fruition causing them to resemble mortars and pestles
those beings you saw who were shaped like pots were formerly bondmen in the service of the sangha
doing so will wither away the act exhaust it and finally put it to rest
once as they were boiling medicinal herbs the monks spoke offensively to them
whereupon they broke the pots in anger as the fruition of that act they have come to resemble pots
as the fruition of that act they have become beings cut at the waist their bodies held together by tendons
in doubt the monks asked he who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
reverend what is it that sangharaksita has done
that the ripened fruit of that action has led him to be born into a rich household with ample wealth and possessions
to actualize arhatship and to inspire the conversion of so many
monks replied the blessed one sangharaksita himself performed the actionswhich have accrued a heap of karma
whose results have matured which follow their course like an irrigation channel
and when the beings you saw who were cut at the waist their bodies held together by tendons
were monks in charge of supplies
hey were overcome by stinginess and switched supplies swapping the summer supplies with those for the winter and switching the winter supplies with those for the summer
which inevitably come to beso who else will experience the actions he himself has performed and accrued
monks actions which have been performed and accrued do not ripen upon the external elements
they do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
likewise virtuous and nonvirtuous actions which have been performed and accrued
come to fruition upon the aggregates elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them for
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons
when the time and the conditions are right they alight upon embodied beings
monks in a time now passed during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years
the blessed buddha kasyapa appeared in the world a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha
a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata one who knew the world
an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
while the blessed buddha kasyapa lived and dwelt in the rsipatana deer park near varanasi
sangharaksita went forth into his teachings and served as a custodian living together with five hundred others
most of the community of people who lived in that hilly fastness came to have great faith in him
though he lived purely his entire life he never attained any of the store of qualities
then one day he fell ill and though he was ministered to with medicinal roots stalks leaves flowers
and fruits the illness would not subside in despair as he was dying he made this prayer
though i have spent my entire life living the holy life under kasyapa the blessed tathagata perfectly awakened buddha and unsurpassed object of veneration
i have not attained any of the store of qualities
asked preceptor have you attained any of the store of qualities
they said
no i have not he replied they asked what prayers have you madehe replied by explaining the prayer he had made
the monk caretakers wards then approached him and
and go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
may these roots of virtue from having spent my entire life living the holy life
young brahmin in the future when the lifespan of beings is one hundred years you will become the tathagata
the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha the knowledgeable and venerable one
the sugata the one who knows the world the unsurpassed guide who tames beings
ensure that i go forth into the teachings of buddha sakyamuni regarding whom the blessed tathagata and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa prophesied to the young brahmin uttara saying
the teacher to gods and men known as the blessed buddha sakyamuni
may we too by taking you our preceptor as our spiritual guide
go forth into the teachings of that very blessed one
and go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
monks the monk who served as monk caretaker in that life was none other than the monk sangharaksita
his five hundred wards are none other than these five hundred seers
the community of people who lived in that hilly fastness are none other than the five hundred merchants
the prayers he made as he lay dying
have led to his abandoning all disturbing emotions actualizing arhatship and inspiring such a massive conversion
the ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negative
while the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive
and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixed
monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions and seek wholly positive actions
monks this is how you should train
in doubt the monks asked he who had severed all doubts the blessed buddha
reverend how did the youthful shapeshifting naga first gain faith
the blessed one replied monks during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years
a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata one who knew the world
a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha
the blessed buddha kasyapa appeared in the world
an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
he lived and dwelt with a following of twenty thousand monks in the rsipatana deer park near varanasi
he taught the dharma to his disciples saying monks make your beds in forests and at the foot of trees
in uninhabited places mountain basins mountain caves and huts of straw
in the open in charnel grounds in jungles at the foot of mountains and at the edges of forests and there practice meditation
monks apply yourselves conscientiously and be sure you will have no regrets later
these are my instructions and my guidance
after the blessed one said this to the monks
the monks went to make their bed in forests and at the foot of trees
in the open in charnel grounds in jungles at the foot of mountains and and at the edges of forests
some practiced meditation on the slopes of sumeru
some practiced meditation on the seven golden mountains
some at lake anavatapta some along gently lapping ponds
nd some in villages towns regions
countryside and kingdoms inhabited by likeminded yogis
meanwhile a young naga born not long before that
was carried off to the top shelf of mount sumeru by the garuda suparni
in time the young naga saw monks of pacific bearing diligently practicing meditation recitation and yoga
seeing them caused great faith to well up in his mind
with his mind filled with faith
these great and noble souls have been freed from sufferings such as mine
it occurred to him
the young naga placed great faith in them and eventually his time came
after which he was born into a brahmin family dedicated to the six duties and in time he grew up under their nurture and care
he later went forth into the perfectly awakened and blessed buddha kasyapas teachings and
through diligence effort and exertion abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship
thus he became an arhat free of desire for the three realms
for whom filth was equal to gold for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand
whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood
and whose knowledge had rent open the shell
he attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdom
he turned his back on worldly gain desires
and esteem and was revered honored and praised by indra and the gods who attend him
on wondering whence have i come where have i been born what actions led to this
he saw that he had been a creature who had died and passed on had been born among humans
and that he had given rise to great faith in great disciples
he then thought of his mother and father from his previous life as a young naga
on wondering where are my parents he saw that they were among the nagas
they replied noble one our young naga
was snatched shortly after his birth by the garuda suparni we do not know where to look for him
he replied father mother i am he
after my time came and i died i was born into a brahmin family dedicated to the six duties
i then went forth into the perfectly awakened and blessed buddha kasyapas teachings and
through diligence effort and exertion abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatship
noble one given the wretched form you had we never imagined you in the higher realms
to say nothing of arhatship
this is indeed amazing and marvelous did you find or attain such a store of qualities
noble one you are an accepter of alms but we are seekers of merit
so every day you must come to this very place and take your meal before returning
after agreeing to that every day he partook of ambrosia in the land of the nagas before returning
some monks asked his novice ward
novice where does your preceptor eat and return from
the novice ward replied i have not inquired
if your preceptor partakes of ambrosia in the land of the nagas before returning here
why do you not go with him
how could i accompany him when he uses his miraculous powers and great might to travel there
when he travels with his miraculous powers hold on to the corner of his robe
will i not fall dear sir even if you were to hang mount sumeru from the corner of his robe it would not fall
what need is there to speak of you
with their encouragement the novice ward went to where his preceptor used his miraculous powers to disappear and waited
when his preceptor disappeared the novice ward grabbed hold of the corner of his preceptors robe and together they rose into the sky above
after a time the nagas caught sight of them and arranged two seats along with two plates of offerings for them
the preceptor thought why have they set out this second seat and plate of offerings
looking behind him he saw the novice and asked
son you too have come yes preceptor i have
goodthe nagas thought
this noble one has miraculous powers and great might and so can digest divine ambrosia
but this noble novice cannot we had better give him ordinary food
to the preceptor they gave divine ambrosia
but to the novice they gave ordinary food
because the novice generally tended to the preceptors begging bowl
he picked up the preceptors begging bowl and on doing so saw that a single grain of rice had stuck to it
the novice put it in his mouth and on tasting it knew it to be divine ambrosia
he thought these nagas are stingy
two sit down together and to one they give divine ambrosia but to the other they give ordinary food
may these roots of virtue from living the holy life under the guidance of the perfectly awakened and blessed buddha kasyapa an unsurpassed object of veneration ensure that i be born right here after i have left this land of the nagas
unable to bear it he made a misguided
prayer
as prodigious and complete actions are not contingent on a change of body
in that very life water began to drip from the novices hands
while the naga host began to suffer a throbbing headache prompting him to demand of the preceptor
noble one this novice has given rise to an ignoble wish
make him repudiate it
the preceptor said to the novice
son reject your ignoble wish to be among themthen the novice spoke this verse
this wish is so farreaching
as i stay here in this land with water falling from my hands i lack the power to reject it
as i stay here in this land with water falling from my hands i lack the power to reject it
thus he lost his life in the land of the nagas only to be reborn again in that very place
he thought as far as culinary pleasures are concerned these ascetic sons of the sakya have it good
but as far as the wealth of dharma is concerned ours is better
so i shall go forth and take my meals here while taking my dharma among my tirthika brethren
with that thought he approached a monk and said
noble one i seek to go forth
his going forth was allowed and he was granted ordination
as the tirthikas purification takes place on the fourteenth day of the month
while the monks purification takes place on the fifteenth day of the month
he would participate in the tirthikas purification on the fourteenth day and the monks on the fifteenth
after some time a day was skipped and the monks purification fell on the fourteenth
which caused him some consternation
should i join them there or participate in the purification here
then he had an idea these ascetic sons of the sakya are more easygoing but my brethren are badtempered
if i dont join them they may even revoke my credentials
and so he attended the tirthikas purification
reassign my seat plank turn my almsbowl upside down throw out my staff and evict me from their ranks
meanwhile the disciplinarian stood at the end of the senior monks row
and that monks is how the youthful shapeshifting naga first gained faith
when this tirthika saw the fine seats arranged there and the array of communal food and drink
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti when a tirthika arrived at the jetavana
when the monks were counted the disciplinarian noticed that the monk who was still committed to his tirthika order was missing so he asked
venerables has the monk monks name come or sent his consent
no
after looking around him into the four directions the blessed one declared let us perform the purification
the monks then looked around them into the four directions and performed the purification
later that same day the monk arrived and the monks asked him
venerable where have you come from
from the company of my brethren
who are your brethren
the tirthikas for i enjoy my food with you and my dharma with them
the monks then asked the blessed one about it and the blessed one decreed
monks this person is a convert to a tirthika order
the venerable upali asked the blessed one
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
you are not a convert to a tirthika order are you
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you you should ask
a person who is a convert to a tirthika order is one who will not flourish in the dharma and vinaya
therefore i would exclude from this dharma and vinaya those persons who are converts to a tirthika order
reverend since the blessed one has said i would exclude from this dharma and vinaya those persons who are converts to a tirthika order
then reverend what is it that makes those persons who are converts to a tirthika order fit for exclusion
and for that alone i would exclude from this dharma and vinaya those persons who are converts to a tirthika order
upali he who bears this banner while still being enamored with that view invites the dusk
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when a householder living in sravasti took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all of their desires
the wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all of his desires then gave birth to a son after which the householder said to her
noble woman our debts are spinning out of control and cutting into our savings
so i will take some merchandise to sell in another land
she replied son of a lord do as you wish
the householder departed with his merchandise for another land where
through indiscretion he came to misfortune
and so his wife with the help of relatives and by her own industry fed and nurtured their son as he grew
in time the lad went with a peer to a house
where a girl sitting on the houses roof threw down a bouquet of flowers to catch his notice
his peer asked friend you havent arranged a rendezvous at this house have you
indeed i have and that is our signal the lad replied
friend this house is illomened dont go in
i warn you through indiscretion you will come to suffering
the lads friend then led him on a long detour that took the entire day
eventually leading him back to his mother to whom the lads friend said
maam your son here has arranged a rendezvous at a girls house
i have safeguarded him the whole day but you must safeguard him through the night
that house is illomened do not let him go in beware through indiscretion he will come to suffering
she said son you have done well to inform me
she arranged a bed for her son in the house along with two clay chamber pots water and fresh earth cover and installed her son in the house saying
i myself will sleep on a cot by the door
mother open the door
why son
i must go out and urinate
son i have placed a chamber pot there urinate in that
he sat down for a bit and then said
i must go out and defecate
son i have placed a chamber pot water and fresh earth cover there defecate in that
again he sat for a bit before saying mother open the door
son do you think i dont know where you want to go
i cannot open the door for you
mother i shall kill you
son i can face my own death but i couldnt bear watching my son die
in the pursuit of passion there is nothing he would not do
his mind merciless and forsaking all thought of future lives
he unsheathed his knife and cut off his mothers head at the neck which tumbled to the floor
having killed his mother he left trembling like a man who has committed a sin
the girl with whom he had a rendezvous said to him
son of a lord there is no one there is no other girl but me do not be afraid
thinking she will be pleased if i tell her what ive done
he said noble woman i have killed my mother for your sake
what your wet nurse or the woman who gave birth to you
the woman who gave birth to me
he has killed his mother without regard for her importance to him thought the girl
what chance would i stand if at some point he became angry with me
then she said to the lad son of a lord please wait a moment while i climb up to the roof of the house
go ahead he replied on reaching the roof
she cried out a thief a thief the lad scared and frightened
fled back to his own house and laid his knife at the doorstep
before crying out that thief has been here he has killed my mother and fled
after performing rites of veneration over his mothers corpse the lad left home
but a person who has done wrong finds no serenity
so he sought out tirthika communities and communities of ascetics and asked
gentlemen what can one do to expunge an evil act
to that some said immolate yourself some said take poison
some said jump off a cliff and some said strangle yourself with a rope
all of them recommended some form of suicide none could offer any means of expiation
later he went to the jetavana where he posed his question to a monk
who recited a verse he who has done some wrong may curb it through virtue to bring light to this life as the sun and moon appear from behind clouds
on hearing this verse the lad thought
ah even wrongdoing can be checked i shall go forth among these people
he then approached the monk and said noble one i seek to go forth
after his going forth was allowed and he was ordained
he applied himself diligently and began to recite the scriptures
in reciting and saying prayers
he recited and mastered the three pitaka and gained the confidence born of knowledge and freedom
the monks asked him venerable what motivates such diligence in you
i must expunge a wrongdoing he replied
what wrongdoing are you guilty of
i killed my mother
your wet nurse or the woman who gave birth to you
my birth mother
the monks asked the blessed one about it and he said to the monks
monks a person who has killed his mother is fit to be excluded from the community
for a person who has killed his mother is one who will not flourish in the dharma and vinaya for that reason
monks you should exclude from this dharma and vinaya those persons who have killed their mothers
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
you should ask are you not a matricide
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
the monk who had killed his mother thought
where will i wind up i must go into the wilds
and with that he went into the wilds
where a householder became his follower
out of deep devotion the householder had a monastery erected for the monk
where monks from various regions and lands came to live many of whom went on to actualize arhatship under his guidance
sometime later the monk matricide fell ill
although the other monks ministered to him with medicinal roots stalks leaves flowers and fruits
he continued to get worse
the monk matricide then told his wards
venerables prepare a sweatchamber for the sangha and for me
his monk wards then prepared a sweatchamber for him
all accumulation ends in depletion all climbs end in falls
all meetings end in separation all life ends in death
so his time came and he died and he was reborn among the denizens of avici the great hell of unrelenting torment
one of his arhat wards entered into meditation to find out where his preceptor had been reborn
and began searching for him among the gods but he did not see him there
nor did he see him when he looked among humans animals and spirits
when he began to search among the denizens of hell
he saw that his preceptor had been reborn among the denizens of avici the great hell of unrelenting torment
the arhat ward wondered if my preceptor was ethical learned
and attracted a following with the dharma
what did he do that it should lead him to be reborn among the denizens of avici
he then saw that it was matricide
struck by the fiery light of avici the monk matricide cried oh the heat in this sweatchamber is too much
as soon as he cried out the guardians of hell lifted their maces and clubbed him on the head
shouting hapless fool where is this sweatchamber of yours
this is avici the great hell of unrelenting torment
this virtuous thought brought the former monk matricides time in hell to an end
and he was reborn among the gods in the realms of the four great kings
it is in the nature of gods and goddesses to have three thoughts shortly after birth
where they have passed on from where they have been born and what action has caused that rebirth
thus the former monk matricide saw he had passed from among the denizens of hell and been reborn among the gods in the realms of the four great kings
due to his having washed the sweatchamber for the sangha
then the young god who had formerly been a denizen of hell had this thought
it would not be right of me to spend a day here without going to see and pay my respects to the blessed one
as the young god sat on a seat the blessed one intuited his thoughts propensities disposition and nature
set out to see the blessed one
on his arrival he strewed the flowers before the blessed one
and bowed his head at the blessed ones feet before taking a place off to one side
the colors of the young god filled the whole of jetavana with a great light
and proceeded to teach the dharma he needed to hear in order to fully realize each of the noble ones four truths
thus actualizing the fruit of a streamenterer
by decimating with the lightning bolt of wisdom the mountain of belief in the transient aggregates with its twenty tall peaks
the young god donned a pair of glittering hooped earrings that swung to and fro
adorned his body with two pearl necklaces one long and one medium in length filled the folds of his skirt with the dazzling colors of divine blue lotus flowers lotuses water lilies and white lotuses
and when night had fallen
thus before the day is out i shall go to see and pay my respects to the blessed one
upon seeing the truth
reverend what the blessed one has done for me my father did not do for me
nor did my mother nor did the king nor did the gods
nor did my ancestors nor did ascetics or brahmins
nor did my circle of loved ones and friends nor did my forebears
dried up the ocean of blood and tears freed me from mountains of bones
shut the door to miserable realms opened the door to higher realms and liberation
dragged me up by the leg from among the denizens of hell animals and spirits
and installed me among gods and humans
the young god spoke this panegyric thrice
the young god spoke again because of you the path to miserable realms of terrible and diverse punishments is blocked
and the road to higher realms of great merit has opened i have even found the way to nirvana
by relying on you one of utter purity i have today gained flawless pure vision
have gained the pacific state pleasing to saints and crossed over the seas of suffering
honored in the world by demigods gods and men free from birth aging illness and death
to see you once in a thousand lives is rare today sage seeing you has proved fruitful
as i bow with my necklace hanging low prostrate at your feet i feel jubilant
circling the one who has tamed his enemies i turn to the heavens and fly into the sky
the young god then departed like a trader who has made a profit
a farmer who has reaped his crops a warrior who has won a battle
or an invalid who has been delivered from all his ills
and in the dress in which he arrived in the blessed ones presence returned home
one of the young gods former wards an elder in the sangha and an arhat was seated in the meal row
while another of his wards was distributing water to the sangha
after a time the sangha elder lifted his cup of water it felt extremely cold to the touch of the tip of his fingers
the preceptor drinks molten copper among the denizens of avici the great hell of unrelenting torment
and he thought while we drink water as cold as this
yet when this arhat elder then searched for his preceptor among the denizens of avici the great hell of unrelenting torment his preceptor was nowhere to be seen
when the arhat elder searched for him among the animals spirits and denizens of other hells
he was nowhere to be seen there either
and so he began to search for him among the gods
there he saw that his preceptor had been reborn among the gods in the realm of the four great kings and
having become a god saw the truth in the blessed ones
presence before returning to remain among the gods
o buddha o dharma o sangha o the wellspoken dharma
by which even wrongdoers led into such fallen states can attain such a collection of qualities
smiling the arhat elder gained faith in the blessed one
and spoke this panegyric
a student of the same preceptor saw him looking jubilant pleased and overjoyed and asked
venerable are you so jubilant pleased and overjoyed by the thought that now that the preceptors time has come you are the sangha elder
the arhat elder replied venerable now is not the time to answer your question
ask me when we are among the sangha and that will prove the time to answer your question
later after the monks of the sangha gathered and were seated
the sangha elder asked their preceptors student
venerable what was it you wanted to ask me
i asked you venerable are you so jubilant pleased and overjoyed by the thought that now that the preceptors time has come you are the sangha elder
while seated among the sangha the arhat elder explained the situation at length to his fellow student
his fellow student then also rejoiced as did the sangha
o buddha o dharma o sangha
o the wellspoken dharma by which even wrongdoers led into fallen states can attain such a collection of qualities
who spoke this panegyric
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
when a householder living in sravasti took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all their desires
the wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all his desires later gave birth to a son
in time the lad went with a peer to a house
where a girl sitting on the houses roof threw down a bouquet of flowers to catch his attention

i have safeguarded him the whole day so you must safeguard him through the night
that house is illomened do not let him enter
beware through indiscretion he will come to suffering
son you have done well to inform me

the man who fathered me
the girl thought he has killed his father without regard for his importance to him
what chance would i stand if at some point he became angry with me
then she said to the lad son of a lord please wait a moment while i climb up to the roof of the house

if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
you should ask are you not a patricide

nor did he see him when he looked among humans animals and spirits
when he began to search among the denizens of hell he saw that his preceptor had been reborn among the denizens of avici the great hell of unrelenting torment
the arhat ward wondered if my preceptor was ethical learned and attracted a following with the dharma
what did he do that it should lead him to be reborn among the denizens of avici
he then saw that it was patricide
struck by the fiery light of avici the former monk patricide exclaimed
oh the heat in this sweatchamber is too much
as soon as he cried out the guardians of hell lifted their maces and clubbed him in the head shouting hapless fool where is this sweatchamber of yours
this is avici the great hell of unrelenting torment
this virtuous thought brought the monk patricides time in hell to an end and he was reborn among the gods in the realms of the four great kings
it is in the nature of gods and goddesses to have three thoughts shortly after birth
where they have passed on from where they have been born
and what action has caused that rebirth
thus the former monk patricide saw that he had passed from among the denizens of hell and been reborn among the gods in the realms of the four great kings due to his having washed the sweatchamber for the sangha
the young god then had this thought
the young god then actualized the fruit of a streamenterer
by decimating with the lightning bolt of wisdom the mountain of belief in the transient aggregates with its twenty tall peaks
proceeded to teach the dharma he needed to hear in order to fully realize each of the noble ones four truths
then as the young god sat on a seat the blessed one intuited his thoughts propensities disposition and nature and
and bowed his head at the blessed ones feet before taking a place off to one side
the colors of the young god filled the whole of jetavana with a great light
and when night had fallen set out for the blessed one
on his arrival he strewed the flowers before the blessed one
it would not be right of me to spend a day here without going to see and pay my respects to the blessed one
thus before the day is out i shall go to see and pay my respects to the blessed one
the young god donned a pair of glittering hooped earrings that swung to and fro
adorned his body with two pearl necklaces one long and one medium in length
filled the folds of his skirt with the dazzling colors of divine blue lotus flowers lotuses water lilies and white lotuses
reverend what the blessed one has done for me my father did not do for me
nor did my mother nor did the king nor did the gods
nor did my ancestors nor did ascetics or brahmins
nor did my circle of loved ones and friends nor did my forebears
for the blessed one has dried up the ocean of blood and tears freed me from mountains of bones
shut the door to miserable realms opened the door to higher realms and liberation
dragged me up by the leg from among the denizens of hell animals and spirits
and installed me among gods and humans
the young god spoke again because of you the path to miserable realms of terrible and diverse punishments is blocked
and the road to higher realms of great merit has opened
i have even found the way to nirvana
by relying on you one of utter purity
i have today gained flawless pure vision
i have gained the pacific state pleasing to saints and crossed over the seas of suffering
honored in the world by demigods gods and men free from birth aging illness and death
to see you once in a thousand lives is rare today sage seeing you has proved fruitful
as i bow with my necklace hanging low prostrate at your feet i feel jubilant
circling clockwise he who has tamed his enemies
i turn to the heavens and fly into the sky
the young god then departed like a trader who has made a profit
a farmer who has reaped his crops a warrior who has won a battle
or an invalid who has been delivered from all his ills
and in the dress in which he arrived in the blessed ones presence returned home
i asked you venerable are you so jubilant pleased and overjoyed by the thought that now that the preceptors time has come you are the sangha elder
the sangha elder asked the student of the same preceptor venerable what was it you wanted to ask me
later after the monks of the sangha gathered and were seated
ask me when we are among the sangha and that will prove the time to answer your question
venerable now is not the time to answer your question
venerable are you so jubilant pleased and overjoyed by the thought that now that the preceptors time has come you are the sangha elder
a student of the same preceptor saw him looking jubilant pleased and overjoyed and asked
smiling the arhat elder gained faith in the blessed one
o buddha o dharma o sangha o the wellspoken dharma
by which even wrongdoers led into such fallen states can attain such a collection of qualities
and spoke this panegyric
when the arhat elder searched for his preceptor among the animals spirits and denizens of other hells he was nowhere to be seen there either
then searched for his preceptor among the denizens of avici the great hell of unrelenting torment he was nowhere to be seen
and so he began to search for him among the gods
there he saw his preceptor had been reborn among the gods in the realm of the four great kings and
having become a god saw the truth in the blessed ones presence before returning to remain among the gods
one of the young gods former wards an elder in the sangha and an arhat was seated in the meal row
while another of his wards was distributing water to the sangha
after a time the sangha elder lifted his cup of water
it felt extremely cold to the touch of the tip of his fingers
and he thought while we drink water as cold as this the preceptor drinks molten copper among the denizens of avici the great hell of unrelenting torment yet when this arhat elder a former ward of the monk patricide
o buddha o dharma o sangha o the wellspoken dharma
by which even wrongdoers led into fallen states can attain such a collection of qualities
who spoke this panegyric
while seated among the sangha the arhat elder explained the situation at length to his fellow student
his fellow student then also rejoiced as did the sangha
a summary killing an arhat causing a schism in the sangha
maliciously drawing blood and suffering one of the four defeats
and three types of suspension
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
one established in the truths
when in the thick of yasti forest the blessed
the king of magadha bimbisara of the guilds along with gods
and hundreds of thousands of magadhan brahmins and householders
bimbisara had the bells rung throughout his land and this pronouncement was read
no one shall steal in my lands
if anyone does so i will banish them and provide recompense from my own stores and treasury
when the blessed one used the analogies of the daharopama sutra to subdue prasenajit
the king of kosala prasenajit too had the bells rung throughout his land and this pronouncement was read
if anyone does so they will face capital punishment
and i will provide recompense from my own stores and treasury
at this the robbers and bandits of magadha and kosala all moved to the borderlands
from their camps they sacked merchant caravans traveling between magadha and kosala
on one occasion a caravan of merchants set out from magadha for kosala with an armed escort
gentlemen i the king had the bells rung and announced
the king then said to the bandits
and said your majesty these are the bandits and these are the stolen goods
taking sixty of the bandits who had been captured alive general virudhaka returned to the king with the stolen goods
some of the bandits abandoned their spoils and fled while some were killed
struck fear into their hearts with the sound of conchs and wardrums
general virudhaka had them surrounded and once the bandits were hemmed in
gentlemen king prasenajit is belligerent and ruthless and if he will recompense us our losses
why do we pay the wages for an armed escort
the escort can turn back now
the escort turned back as the caravan of traders continued reduced in numbers
the bandits though had posted a lookout who was lying in wait and
when he caught sight of them he asked gentlemen why do you sit indifferent when a small caravan of traders is approaching
without reflection arhats do not have access to prescience and insight and so the life of an arhat traveling with the merchants was also taken
other merchants abandoned their goods and fled
with that the bandits set upon the caravan taking the lives of some merchants as
pressing their palms together they said
your majesty in your lands we have been reduced to a state where we are not fit to be merchants
those merchants who had fled sought out king prasenajit their faces and bodies smeared with dirt howling their hair in disarray
what happened we were sacked by bandits
in what region in a region near the borderlands
the king commanded his general virudhaka
bring me the stolen goods and the bandits and be quick about it
as virudhaka set out at the head of the four branches of the armed forces
the bandits were sitting around unconcerned with their armor off in a sala forest dividing their spoils
no one shall steal in my lands
if anyone does so they will face capital punishment and i will provide recompense from my own stores and treasury
did you not hear we heard your majesty
well then why did you rob the merchants we have no other means of making a living your majesty
why did you take life to instill fear
you may have instilled some fear but the fear i instill today shall be like none ever seen before
the king then ordered his ministers gentlemen execute all of these men today
as they were being led to the execution grounds their sentences were proclaimed along the high roads and side streets at intersections and crossroads
in the commotion one bandit escaped in the midst of a crowded street and approached a monk in the jetavana and said
noble one i seek to go forth
the monk allowed the bandits going forth and ordained him while the other bandits were being executed
the blessed one had advised monks again and again you should be able to scrutinize your own failings others failings your own strengths and others strengths
why is that so
because your own failings and others failings act as a spur to disenchantment
while your own strengths and others strengths also act as a spur to disenchantment
in the light of this advice the monks had taken to visiting the charnel ground
this is my brother this is my uncle on my fathers side
the bandit turned monk replied this is my father
when he began to sob the monks asked venerable why do you make such a fuss
the monks said venerables though he has only newly gone forth he has such a kind heart
when the time came for the monks to visit the charnel grounds again the bandit turned monk accompanied them and there he saw that the other bandits had been executed he stood still choked with tears
these men took the life of an arhat said the monks
when the bandit turned monk admitted they had taken the life of an arhat the monks asked the blessed one about it
and the blessed one decreed monks this person has killed an arhat
a person who has killed an arhat is one who will not flourish in the dharma and vinaya
therefore monks you should exclude from this dharma and vinaya those persons who have killed an arhat
if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
you should ask you are not a killer of an arhat are you
if you allow going forth and grant ordination without asking this a serious breach occurs
the venerable upali asked the blessed buddha
again seeks monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya in the blessed ones presence
reverend if a person who caused a schism among the tathagatas sangha disciples in a previous ordination career
should his going forth be allowed or not
upali his going forth should not be allowed
you should ask you have not caused a schism in the sangha have you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
reverend if a person who has maliciously drawn blood from a tathagata seeks monkhood
you should ask you have not maliciously drawn blood from a tathagata have you
if you allow going forth without asking this a serious breach occurs
the venerable upali asked the blessed buddha
reverend if a person who has fallen by committing any of the four actions leading to defeat during a previous ordination career
seeks monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
should his going forth be allowed or not
upali his going forth should not be allowed
therefore if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
you should ask you have not fallen by committing any of the four acts leading to defeat have you
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
the blessed one then said to the monks
monks if a person who has been suspended for refusing to acknowledge a transgression returns
and says venerables i acknowledge the transgression please allow my going forth
then you should allow his going forth
once he has gone forth if he says venerables i confess my transgression
please grant me ordination
then he should be granted ordination
if perchance after being ordained he should say i do not acknowledge the transgression
and suspensions meted out for refusing to give up deviant views
the same conditions apply to suspensions meted out for refusing to amend ones behavior
then provided there is a majority within the sangha he should be suspended for refusing to acknowledge the transgression
for it is difficult for a person to find monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
in the event that there is no majority within the sangha and he has been ordained the ordination is to be judged valid
an index those with missing hands missing legs
those with hands of webbed fingers with no lips whose bodies are marked
the very old the very young the lame those with deformed lower parts those missing an eye
those worn out by women worn out by burdens
missing hands hunchbacks dwarves those with goiters the mute the deaf those with mobility aids with elephantiasis
those people worn out by the road with debilitating digestive disorders and cretins
the great seer forbade people such as this
knowing all the perfectly awakened one whose name denotes truth proclaimed
that going forth is for the gracious and ordination for the pure
the blessed buddha was resident at the jetavana anathapindadas grove near sravasti
and with that he allowed his going forth and ordination
dear sir the blessed ones teachings are characterized by compassion i shall allow your going forth
he replied noble one as i have no hands no one will allow me to go forth
dear sir why do you not go forth
some time later upananda was out for a stroll when he saw a man missing his hands and said
lets allow to go forth the sort that these black begging bowl carriers wont snatch away
everyone we allow to go forth they up and snatch away
when this came up in conversation
nanda and upananda said these black begging bowl carriers might as well be snatching babies
on the advice of the teacher they would on occasion simply look in on their wards
once the wards could recognize a rogue they were entrusted as wards to sound monks
as was their wont the group of six
kept as wards anyone whose going forth had been allowed and who had been ordained but who could not recognize a rogue
after two or three days of teaching him how dharma practitioners conduct themselves
upananda said dear sir game does not eat other game
the whole of sravasti is your field and fatherland so seek out alms and live on them
preceptor how am i to go begging alms
do you not know even that much i will show you
upananda tied the handless monks lower robe on with a cord fastened his dharma robe up with a pin
placed his begging bowl in the crook of his left arm and nestled his monks staff in the crook of his right arm
the handless monk had entered sravasti on his rounds when a woman beat on his chest and cried
noble one who cut off the hands of a renunciant
sister he replied my hands were cut off when i was still a householder
they were not cut off after i went forth
who allowed your going forth the preceptor upananda
the people said who else but a rogue would allow the going forth of someone like him
the monks then asked the blessed one about it
and the blessed one thought
all those shortcomings ensue from the monks allowing the going forth of those without hands
then the blessed one decreed monks in light of this monks should not allow going forth nor grant ordination to those who are missing hands
a serious breach occurs if you allow their going forth and grant them ordination
just as it is so for those missing hands it is also so for those missing legs
hose with hands of webbed fingers those with no lips those whose bodies are marked or the very old
monks if you allow the going forth of those who are too young
they will spoil the sanghas bedding with urine and feces
the blessed one decreed their going forth should not be allowed either
the going forth of the lame is also being allowed the blessed one said
neither should their going forth be allowed
thus concludes the chapter on going forth
the blessed one said people such as they should not be allowed to go forth
if you allow them to go forth a serious breach occurs
monks the going forth of those worn out by women those worn out by burdens
those worn out by the road those with debilitating digestive disorders
there are also other cases that warrant further exclusion
the going forth of loose women those missing an eye those missing hands hunchbacks dwarves those with goiters the mute the deaf cripples and those with elephantiasis are also being allowed
and cretins are also being allowed
the blessed one said
why have you gone forth whose dharma do you favor
the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
while coming to see the blessed one died en route
and thus was prevented from obtaining
whether you be childish or wise
the ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negative
a monk ward or apprentice should plead with great vigor oh the sangha should not mete out such disciplinary acts to my preceptor or instructor
a monk ward or apprentice should plead with great vigor oh the sangha should impose a demotion or a repeat demotion on those preceptors and instructors
a monk ward or apprentice should plead with great vigor oh the preceptor or instructor upon whom a demotion or a repeat demotion has been imposed should be given a probation or a repeat probation instead
the two sons of noble anandas sister have gone forth and since they act and apply themselves diligently
when their time has come and they die they will be reborn here so these two have been reserved for them
overjoyed they went to mahamaudgalyayana
did you see something noble one we did
what gods
what were they doing
we could hear the sounds of the vina ektara balari mahati and the sughosak and found two palaces strewn with beds and divans replete with goddesses
monks what do you think which is more the dirt i take from the tip of my fingernail or the dirt that is upon this earth
hence now the ripened fruit of the venerable custodians action has led him to be born into a rich household with ample wealth and possessions
thus have i heard at one time
the bhagavat was dwelling on the vulture peak mountain in rajgir on a summit of infinite gems in the womb of dharmadhatu palace
together with a great assembly of twentyfive thousand monks all of them were arhats who had exhausted their outflows
they were without afflictions and controlled
their minds were perfectly liberated
and their wisdom was perfectly free
they were knowledgeable great elephants who had accomplished what needed to be done
they had laid down their burden and fulfilled their own benefit
they had destroyed the bonds of existence and
thanks to their correct knowledge their minds were perfectly liberated
youthful manjusri
dhanasri
buddhisri
bhaisajyaraja and
bhaisajyasamudgata
all of them were turning the dharma wheel that does not turn back
they were skilled in inquiring about the vaipulya sutras of the heap of jewels and
and had obtained the level called cloud of dharma
in terms of wisdom they were like sumeru
and all of them had thoroughly cultivated the dharmas of emptiness no sign no wish no arising no birth and no existence
the greatly profound dharma appeared to them
and they had the postures of the tathagatas
in other world spheres they had been sent out by quintillions of tathagatas
all of them were fully clairvoyant and well settled in the essential nature of all dharmas
at that time
the bhagavat thought to generate great swiftness strength impetus and stamina in the bodhisattva great beings
i shall give a dharma discourse
from as many world spheres as there are grains of sand in the river ganges
i shall cause splendorous bodhisattva great beings to assemble
hence i will display a sign to show that there is to be a great teaching of the dharma
i shall cause a great light so that bodhisattva great beings shall come to me and ask for a great dharma teaching
the bhagavat illuminated the ten directions with great clouds of light rays that shone in as many worlds as there are atoms of dust in the great trichiliocosman uncountable and inconceivable number
as many bodhisattva great beings as there are atoms of dust in ten ineffable quintillion buddhafields approached him from all the ten directions
present with the bhagavat were seventytwo quintillion bodhisattvas
each and every bodhisattva great being arrived with exceptional feats beyond imagination
they first performed a fitting inconceivable worship of the bhagavat
and then sat down in front of him on lotus seats that appeared through the force of their aspirations
they stayed still looking at the bhagavat without blinking
a lion throne within a great jeweled lotus then appeared at the center of the womb of dharmadhatu palace it was an uncountable number of leagues in width and of unprecedented height
it was made of gems and jewels sparkling in every way
with lightning for lamps and a surrounding railing made of gems and jewels
its staffs were of gems and jewels of inconceivable brilliance
and incomparable gems and jewels enclosed it
jewel garlands splendid beyond comparison beautified the throne
studded with many types of precious gems
it was hung about with raised parasols standards and flags
from above the lion throne within the great lotus of gems and jewels ten innumerable quintillions of light rays now issued forth
in all directions and illumined the very many world spheres in the ten directions by their great brightness
and at that very time from each and every one of the ten directions gods
nagas
yaksas
gandharvas
demigods
garuda
kinnaras
great serpents
sakras
brahmas
and world protectors arrived as many as there are atoms of dust in the ineffable quintillion buddhafields
some of them arrived together with a quintillion apsaras uncountable and beyond conception singing and playing musical instruments while they sat in jeweled palaces
some arrived with palaces that were made of flowers
others with palaces were made of heaps of uragasara sandalwood
some palaces were made of pearls others of diamonds
and others still of gems and jewels that shone like diamonds
some were made of gold from the river jambu
and others were built with gems that shone in all colors
some were made of the vasiraja gem and others of wishfulfilling jewels
still other palaces were made of those gems worn by sakra
yet others arrived with uncountable inconceivable quadrillions of apsaras singing and playing musical instruments while they sat in palaces of great jewels gems beaming uninterruptedly from the array of pure oceanground jewels
as they arrived they first worshipped the bhagavat in an inconceivable matchless immeasurable and limitless manner
then they arranged themselves on one side on seats that manifested through their own aspirations
they stayed still looking at the bhagavat without blinking
at that very moment this world sphere a great trichiliocosm turned into jambu river gold
it was adorned with trees of many great gems and jewels
divine flowering trees
trees of fine fabrics
it was covered with a net of precious moon gems sun gems and vidyutpradipa gems
parasols standards and flags were hoisted
nnumerable quintillions of apsaras with half their bodies in sight thronged all trees which were enveloped by strings of pearls and garlands of great precious jewels
at that time these verses rang out from the lion throne with its great jeweled lotus inside
i came about by the force of your merit
come be seated king of the best among men
victor best among the twofooted
fulfilling my wish today i shall support you
my body is made of jewels
oh guide for your sake at my center is a beautiful jewel lotus
protector please fulfill my wish today
seated on this jewel lotus
you shall beautify this entire world and me
hearing such dharma one obtains a lion throne like this
you shall teach the dharma to many millions of living beings
thousands of light rays shining from your limbs illuminate many world spheres
this is the sign of someone in whom joy is born
guide ascend to me
in the past in this very place i have supported eighty million selfarisen sages
quickly take your seat and grant your favor
may the bhagavat also today bestow his favor
at this the bhagavat arose from his previous seat and
sat down on the lion throne with its great jewel lotus inside he sat with his legs crossed and observed the entire gathering of bodhisattvas
then to those bodhisattva great beings he signaled that he was about to deliver a distinguished dharma teaching
at that very time the entire assembly of bodhisattvas had the thought
the youthful manjusri should now inquire of the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha about nonarising and noncessation we have not heard that dharma teaching for a long time
the youthful manjusri had understood the bhagavats signal
and he also knew what the bodhisattva great beings were thinking
so he arose and adjusted his upper robe so that one shoulder was uncovered
he then knelt in front of the bhagavat with his right knee placed in the center of a lotus
with joined palms he then addressed this question to the bhagavat
bhagavat nonarising and noncessation have been spoken of
bhagavat to what dharma do the terms nonarising and noncessation refer
he also expressed his question in verse
of noncessation and nonarising
guide you speak
greatly wise one how do you explain those terms
noncessation and nonarising
why are they called so
through analogies and reasons
great sage please tell us
these many bodhisattvas have come here
wishing for awareness they were sent to salute you
by many guides of the world
so please teach the lofty and excellent good dharma
the bhagavat said to the youthful manjusri
you are striving for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people and with compassion for the world
you are doing so for the goodness benefit and happiness of a great group of beings both gods and men
you are also acting so that the bodhisattva great beings who have come here may obtain the level of a buddha
good manjusri good
manjusri it is good that you think to ask the tathagata about this matter
you should apply yourself to this point without alarm without fear and without hesitation
and manjusri you must rely on awareness
it is as follows manjusri imagine that this wide earth were made entirely of beryl
so that in that beryl one could see reflections of the abode of the thirtythree of sakra lord of the gods and of his palace of victory
and imagine that sakra lord of the gods could be seen there playing and enjoying himself with the five divine objects of pleasure
at that time the gods might call out to all the men women boys and girls of jambudvipa
come here men and women
look at sakra lord of the gods as he is playing enjoying and amusing himself with the five divine objects of pleasure in his palace of victory
come all men and women
offer gifts and make merits
take up discipline and abide by it
hen you shall also get to play enjoy and amuse yourself in such palaces of victory
you will become like sakra himself and will come to possess wealth like his the lord of the gods sakra has all divine enjoyments and so shall you
then manjusri all those men women girls and boys who could see the abode of the thirtythree along with sakra lord of the gods and his palace of victory reflected in the wide earth of beryl
would fold their hands toward this reflection they would scatter flowers and offer perfumes toward it saying
may we also obtain such a body as that of sakra lord of the gods
may we also play enjoy and amuse ourselves in the palace of victory just like sakra lord of the gods
however those beings would not understand that this would merely be a reflection in the wide earth of beryl a reflection occurring due to the complete purity of the beryl wherein the abode of the thirtythree along with sakra lord of the gods and his palace of victory could be seen
wishing for the state of sakra they would then offer gifts and make merits
they would take up discipline and abide by that they would then dedicate the roots of what is wholesome toward birth in that reflection of the abode of the thirtythree
manjusri in that wide earth of beryl there would of course be no abode of the thirtythree and neither would there be a palace of victory or sakra lord of the gods
however due to the purity of the great beryl
the abode of the thirtythree along with the palace of victory and sakra lord of the gods would all be visible
nonexistent nonarisen and nonceased their reflections would be seen because of the purity of the great beryl
in the same way manjusri it is due to the complete purity of the mind as well as due to proper cultivation that sentient beings see the body of a tathagata
manjusri it is due to the power of the tathagata that sentient beings see him
and still he remains nonexistent nonarisen and nonceased
he is neither existence nor nonexistence
neither visible nor invisible
neither worldly nor unworldly
neither an object of thinking nor not an object of thinking
neither existent nor nonexistent
it is so manjusri that sentient beings focus on the reflection of the tathagata
and offer it flowers perfumes garments and jewels while making this aspiration
may we also become like the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha
wishing for a buddhas awareness
they offer gifts and make merit
they take up discipline and abide by it
then they dedicate that root of what is wholesome toward obtaining a tathagatas awareness
it is as follows manjusri
the reflection of sakra ruler of the gods on that wide earth made of beryl does not move
nor does he think elaborate construct or conceptualize
it is not a construct not a concept inconceivable and not a mental placement
he is peaceful and cool nonarising and noncessation
not seen not heard not smelt not tasted not touched
not a sign not a cognition and not something that can be made known
in the same way manjusri the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha does not move
he is not a construct not a concept inconceivable not a mental placement
manjusri the tathagata is in the realm of nonarising
on the other hand he appears in the world as a reflected image
according to the beliefs of sentient beings he displays diverse appearances and diverse lifespans
he appears among sentient beings who have become fitting receptacles for awakening thanks to their maturation and belief
these sentient beings then hear the dharma according to their dispositions and beliefs
according to their dispositions they understand the three vehicles
it is as follows manjusri
a great dharma drum for making sounds of dharma which come about through the force of merit of the gods of the thirtythree
is placed in the atmosphere above the vaijayanta palace
beyond visible range the divine scions cannot see it or behold it
however manjusri it is a great dharma drum
sometimes the gods in the heaven of the thirtythree become so intensely and continuously oblivious from playing with enjoying and delighting themselves with their divine pleasures
that they fail to enter the divine hall called sudharma to jointly chant the dharma
and manjusri sakra lord of the gods becomes so intensely and continuously oblivious from playing with enjoying and delighting himself with his divine pleasures
that he fails to sit on his dharma seat to speak of the dharma
manjusri at such times that great dharma drum
not to be seen or beheld hanging in the atmosphere beyond visible range
plays a dharma sound that addresses all the gods in the heaven of the thirtythree
friends form sound smell flavor and touch are impermanent
do not be careless
do not quickly fall down from this abode
friends all coproducing factors are suffering
friends all coproducing factors are empty
friends all coproducing factors are without self
for those who die and fall from here to take birth here once again is difficult
do not become careless
delight in the pleasant joy of dharma
being inclined toward the dharma
with dharma pouring like rain recollecting and placing the dharma in the mind
you shall not then have to part from these divine enjoyments and delights in games of pleasure
at that time manjusri due to the sound of that great dharma drum
invisible formless inconceivable not a mental construct
out of sight
unborn unceasing beyond the way of words
and devoid of mind mentality and consciousness
all the gods in the heaven of the thirtythree are roused scared alarmed and very distressed
they enter the divine hall called sudharma
delighting in the pleasant joy of dharma
they make the dharma their essence
they become inclined toward the dharma
recollecting and keeping the dharma in mind
when they die and fall from that abode they will again reach excellent places
sakra the king of the gods then enters sudharma the divine hall
takes a seat on the dharma throne and teaches the dharma
manjusri when the demigods battle against the gods
whenever the gods of the heaven of the thirtythree are being defeated
the dharma drum emits a sound that makes the demigods so frightened alarmed agitated and distressed that they flee
nevertheless manjusri that great dharma drum does not have a producer
nor does it have a body
manjusri that dharma drum is invisible
not to be beheld not true
not real with no mind without intention
signless
voiceless
immaterial
nondual
and out of sight
nevertheless manjusri for those gods in the heaven of the thirtythree who have previously purified themselves
a sound comes forth from the great dharma drum
it occurs to pacify all the misfortunes troubles and afflictions of the gods of the thirtythree
manjusri in the same way that from that great dharma drum
invisible
not to be beheld
not true not real with no mind without intention
signless
formless
voiceless immaterial
nondual
and out of sight
that sound of dharma occurs to pacify all the misfortunes troubles and afflictions of the gods of the thirtythree
so too manjusri although the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha is invisible
not true not real
with no mind without intention
and out of sight nevertheless
manjusri sentient beings perceive the voice of dharma due to the maturation of previous karma according to their individual aspirations and interests
and that sound of dharma occurs to pacify all misfortunes troubles and afflictions of all sentient beings
being the voice of dharma it is regarded in the world as the voice of the tathagata
manjusri there is no tathagata
however the designation tathagata comes about in the world because of the voice of dharma
it is exclusively due to the maturation of sentient beings previous wholesome karma
that they perceive the voice of the tathagata
that voice emerges in order to produce happiness for all sentient beings and to prompt those who are careless
manjusri as those sentient beings hear that sound
they form the concept of a tathagata thinking this is the tathagatas body
the speech of the tathagata is heard so that beginner bodhisattvas and all immature ordinary people may generate roots of what is wholesome by taking the tathagata as their reference point
however manjusri the tathagata should be known to be nonarisen and nonceasing
it is as follows manjusri
at the end of summertime during the first month of rains
due to the maturation of sentient beings previous karma
and to generate out of the multitudes of seeds and elements all the grass thickets medicinal herbs and trees on earth
winds begin to blow in the atmosphere and the sky above
then water comes about due to that wind and it falls on the great earth
thus the great earth is satisfied
and all sentient beings in jambudvipa are joyful and happy
referring to this the notion of a cloud comes about in the world
manjusri whenever not much rain falls from the atmosphere and the sky above
all the sentient beings in jambudvipa think here there is not a cloud
but when manjusri a lot of rain falls on the great earth from the atmosphere and the sky above
they say oh a great cloud is pouring down water
satisfying the great earth
however manjusri when this happens there is neither a cloud nor anything that can be designated as a cloud
a large mass of water is generated by the wind and then it falls from the atmosphere above
disappears in the atmosphere itself
manjusri that cumulus of water above in the atmosphere stirred by the wind and releasing water is designated a cloud due to the maturation of sentient beings previous karma
manjusri no cloud can be found there
nor anything that could be designated a cloud
manjusri the cloud is nonarisen and nonceasing
it does not enter the way of mind and it is free from coming and going
in the same way manjusri for bodhisattva great beings who have accumulated previous roots of what is wholesome
for other sentient beings who wish for the awareness of a hearer or a pratyekabuddha
and for those sentient beings who have accumulated roots of what is wholesome and possess the causes to be shown the path to nirvana
the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha with unobstructed brilliance comes to be counted as arisen in the world
whatever he says is thus tatha undistorted thus and not otherwise therefore
he was given the name tathagata among gods and men
manjusri this word appears among gods and men tathagata
however manjusri there is no tathagata to be found
the tathagata manjusri is not a sign
and he is free from signs
he is unreal nonarisen and nonceasing
on the other hand manjusri the appearance of the tathagata satisfies and entertains this world including the gods
and then due to the ripening of previous karma of beginner bodhisattvas and immature ordinary people who are guided by means of nirvana
they think the tathagata has passed into complete nirvana
however manjusri the tathagata neither arises nor ceases
the tathagata manjusri is nonarisen and nonceasing
manjusri when some water is taken as a point of reference for an unreal cloud
that has not arisen nor ceased and is nonexistent
the designation cloud is established in the world in the very same way
it is as follows manjusri
every day the great and unsurpassed brahma who controls ten trichiliocosms looks upon all the classes of gods as far as the class of the gods of the four great kings
at that time manjusri while the great brahma who controls ten trichiliocosms looks upon all the classes of gods
they all abandon their games of pleasure delights and enjoyments
they respectfully fold their hands
and look toward the great brahma without blinking
for a moment the great brahma offers sight of himself to all the classes of gods
at that time the gods all long to be born in the world of the great brahma
and they dedicate their roots of what is wholesome toward taking birth in the world of the great brahma
moreover manjusri that great brahma without falling down from that brahma palace
thanks to the power of his previous aspirations and due to the prior accumulation of virtue on the part of the gods
empowers another great brahma as the controller of ten trichiliocosms
manjusri that emanated great brahma looks upon all the classes of gods as far as the class of the gods of the four great kings
at that time manjusri
among all the classes of gods all the scions of the gods abandon their games of pleasure delights and enjoyments
they stop playing their percussion instruments and halt their singing
shifting their attention from their games of pleasure and delights
they respectfully fold their hands and look toward the great brahma without blinking
at that time the gods all long to be born in the world of the great brahma and they dedicate their roots of what is wholesome toward taking birth in the world of the great brahma
still manjusri no brahma is there to be found
manjusri brahma is empty dependent
unreal without syllables
without voice without place
and also not an existent thing he is inconceivable
without signs and free from mentality mind and consciousness
he is nonarisen and unceasing
and yet manjusri a semblance of him offering sight of himself appears among all the classes of gods by the power of his own previous roots of what is wholesome and aspirations and due to the previous accumulations of roots of what is wholesome on the part of those gods
yet manjusri those gods do not think this brahma is an emanation
empty dependent
unreal without syllables
without voice without place
not an existent thing
and free from mentality mind and consciousness
he is nonarisen and unceasing
manjusri in the same manner the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha is empty
dependent unreal without syllables without voice without place and also not an existent thing
he is inconceivable without signs and free from mentality mind and consciousness
this is due to the power of his previous aspirations during his practice as a bodhisattva and also due to the power of all the roots of what is wholesome of the beginner bodhisattvas of those who set out on the vehicles of the hearers and the pratyekabuddhas as well as of all the immature ordinary people
he is seen in the world as a tathagata adorned with hundreds of thousands of marks like a reflected image and he does not move from his place
yet manjusri from the body of the tathagata adorned with hundreds of thousands of marks during all the empty postures of a tathagata
a great dharma teaching emanates for the sake of varied sentient beings with diverse beliefs
that dharma teaching occurs to pacify all the troubles harms and afflictions of all sentient beings
in that regard the tathagata is the same neutral without concepts and does not make any distinctions
thus manjusri through this explanation you should understand that nonarising and noncessation is an appellation of the tathagata
then at that time the bhagavat spoke the following two stanzas
the tathagata always has the quality of nonarising
and all dharmas resemble the sugata
yet immature minds by their grasping at signs
roam the world among nonexistent dharmas
the tathagata is a reflected image
of the wholesome dharma without
yet here there is no tathata and no tathagata
while an image is seen in the entire world
it is as follows manjusri
here in jambudvipa the rays of the sun only shine at first on the great king of mighty mountains
after that they shine on the cakravada and mahacakravada ranges
after that they shine on the elevated regions of the earth
after that they shine on the lowlying regions of the earth here in jambudvipa
yet those sun rays manjusri do not form mental constructs or concepts
they do not think or ponder
the rays of the sun manjusri are free from mentality mind and consciousness
they are unborn and unceasing without characteristics free from characteristics
without mental placement free from mental placement
without elaboration free from elaboration
without torment free from torment
not abiding hither not abiding thither
not high not low
not bound not liberated
not knowing not ignorant
not afflictions not free from afflictions
not speaking the truth not speaking falsely
not over there not here
not on dry land not in the stream
not the domain of reasoning not the domain of nonreasoning
neither with form nor formless
yet manjusri due to the distinction of higher middling and lower places on the earth
the light shines differently at higher middling and lower degrees causing varied shades
in the same way manjusri the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha does not form mental constructs or concepts
manjusri the tathagata is free from mind mentality and consciousness
not speaking the truth not speaking falsely
not on the shore nor on the nonshore
he is not omniscient not nonomniscient
not reasoning not nonreasoning
not acting not nonacting
neither mindful nor unmindful
neither with intention nor free from intention
neither mind nor without mind
neither originated nor unoriginated
neither name nor no name
neither form nor no form
neither verbal expression nor nonverbal expression
neither a possible object of imputation nor not a possible object of imputation
neither visible nor invisible
neither a conducive way nor not a conducive way
neither leading along the way nor not leading along the way
neither having obtained the result nor not having obtained the result
neither a concept nor not a concept
neither free from concepts nor not free from concepts
similarly manjusri the rays of awareness from the round sun of the tathagata shine brilliantly in the three realms unimpeded throughout the dharmadhatu with neither edge nor center
once they shine they first descend upon the bodies of bodhisattvas whose aspirations are like the great lord of mountains
after that they descend upon the bodies of those who set forth on the vehicle of pratyekabuddhas
then they descend upon the bodies of those who have set forth on the hearers vehicle
after that they descend upon the body of sentient beings with wholesome aspirations according to their specific inclinations
after that the rays of awareness from the round sun of the tathagata even descend upon the body of those sentient beings with mental continua that are stuck in what is wrong
the rays assist all these beings by producing causes for what will come later and increase their wholesome dharmas
in that respect manjusri the tathagata is everywhere the same neutral without concepts and does not make any distinctions
moreover manjusri the round sun of the tathagatas awareness does not think i will teach this person the vast dharma
but i will not teach that one neither do they have the concept
this person has vast beliefs
that one has middling beliefs
this one has belief in the hearers vehicle
this one has wholesome aspirations
while that one is low with wrong aspirations manjusri the round sun of the tathagatas awareness does not think
this sentient being has vast beliefs so i will teach him the great vehicle
this one has middling beliefs
so i will teach him the pratyekabuddha vehicle
this one has belief in the hearers vehicle
so i will teach him the hearers vehicle
i shall come to understand the aspirations of sentient beings with either wholesome or unwholesome aspirations
then purify them
and straighten up their view even for sentient beings stuck in what is wrong
the light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the tathagata does not have any such concepts
and why
on the other hand manjusri because of variations in sentient beings inclinations to wholesome intent the light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the tathagata is varied too
because the light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the tathagata has cut off all constructs concepts and elaborations
it is as follows manjusri
in the great ocean there is a great precious jewel called fulfilling all wishes
i shall teach a fitting dharma
manjusri when the teaching of the dharma is taken as a point of reference for an unreal tathagata who has not arisen nor ceased and who is nonexistent and primordially unborn
the designation the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha becomes established in the world
in the very same way manjusri the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha does not form mental constructs
it is inconceivable free from what can be conceived and free from mind mentality and consciousness
he does not think or ponder
he is not obtained not obtainable
he is inconceivable free from what can be conceived and free from mind mentality and consciousness
he is nongrasping the act of not holding on
he has eliminated arbitrary truths as well as attachment aversion and delusion
he is neither true nor false
neither permanent nor impermanent
neither shining nor not shining
neither worldly nor nonworldly
he is without deliberation or analysis he is nonarisen and unceasing
he is inconceivable imponderable essenceless and not possibly an essence
he is empty of nonexistence
he is not bliss
he is free from bliss
he is the destruction of bliss
when it is attached to the top of a banner
and a sentient being makes a wish sentient beings will perceive corresponding words coming forth from the jewel however that great precious jewel does not form mental constructs or concepts
he is not a conventional expression
he is the cutting off of conventional expressions
he cannot be clung to
he is free from striving or giving anything up
it does not think or ponder
he cannot be counted
he is free from counting
and has cut off all conventional expressions
he has cut off all movement
he is not movement he has reached nonmovement
he is not space
he is ungraspable
he cannot be seen or beholden
not lack of space
not an assemblage
and not a nonassemblage
he is neither mentally constructed nor not mentally constructed
he is not visible
not to be described
he is not established shown afflicted or purified
he is not established shown afflicted or purified
he is not name
not form
not sign
not karma
not the maturation of karma
he is not past
not future
not present
he is nothing whatsoever
he is without impurity
without syllables
without voice
not speech
beyond a voice
he is not a characteristic
he is free from all characteristics
not perceived inside outside or in between
and manjusri the awareness jewel of the tathagata is completely pure in its intent and is fixed at the top of the banner of great compassion
according to his or her inclinations and beliefs a sentient being perceives a dharma teaching issuing forth from that jewel
and in this respect manjusri the tathagata is the same neutral without concepts and does not make any distinctions
it is as follows manjusri
sentient beings perceive an echo issuing forth as the intimation of someone elses speech
but that echo is not past future or present
it cannot be perceived inside outside or in between
it is nonarisen
and unceasing
it is not cut off
not permanent
it is not endowed with awareness
nor is it without awareness
it is neither wisdom
nor not wisdom
neither knowledge
nor ignorance
neither liberation
nor not liberation
it is neither blameworthy
nor free from blame
neither recollection
nor nonrecollection
neither placed
nor unplaced
nor not sitting
neither sitting
it is not the earth element
not the water element
not the fire element
and not the wind element
it is neither coproduced
nor unproduced
neither free from elaboration
nor with elaboration
neither speech
nor not speech
and neither visible
nor invisible
it is without syllables
without voice
beyond voice
without comparison
beyond comparison
not a characteristic
free from characteristics
it is neither peace nor not peace
neither long nor short
neither sentient nor insentient
neither mental nor not mental
it is neither to be beheld nor not to be beheld
free from mind mentality and consciousness
not analysis
it is not deliberation
it is empty of the nature of seeing
it is nonrecollection
nonmentalplacement
in all regards it is the same neutral without concepts and does not make any distinctions
it is beyond the three times
however
in the very same way manjusri the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha is not past future or present
he cannot be perceived inside outside or in between
he is nonarisen
unceasing
he is not cut off
not permanent
he is not endowed with awareness nor is he without awareness
he is neither with wisdom nor without wisdom
he is neither knowledge nor ignorance
neither liberation nor not liberation
he is neither blameworthy nor free from blame
neither with recollection nor without recollection
neither placed nor unplaced
neither sitting nor not sitting
he is not the earth element
not the water element
not the fire element
and not the wind element
and sentient beings perceive it to be just that way
manjusri the echo the voice of many sounds comes forth for sentient beings with varied inclinations as the intimation of the voice of many sounds
not the water element
not the fire element
and not the wind element
he is neither coproduced nor unproduced
neither elaboration nor nonelaboration
neither speech nor not speech
and neither visible nor invisible
he is without syllables
without voice
beyond voice
without comparison
beyond comparison
not a characteristic
free from characteristics
he is neither peaceful nor not peaceful
neither long nor short
neither mental nor not mental
he is neither to be beheld nor not to be beheld
he is nonrecollection
he is empty of the nature of seeing
and nonmentalplacement
he is not deliberation
not analysis
and free from mind mentality and consciousness
he is beyond the three times
in all regards he is the same neutral without concepts and does not make any distinctions
yet manjusri sentient beings with varied beliefs perceive
yet manjusri sentient beings with varied beliefs perceive the speech of the tathagata issuing forth in accordance with their manifold inclinations
the speech of the tathagata issuing forth in accordance with their manifold inclinations
it is as follows manjusri
it is through having the earth as their basis and support that all grass thickets herbs and trees grow to become sizeable
but manjusri the earth does not form mental constructs or concepts
with respect to everything it is the same free from concepts
and free from mind mentality and consciousness
and free from mind mentality and consciousness
free from distinctions
it is free from speculations
in the same way manjusri it is through having the tathagata as their basis and support
or of all tirthikas such as the carakas parivrajakas and nirgranthas and so forth or of any others down to the roots of what is wholesome of those stuck in what is wrong it is through having the tathagata as their basis and support that they grow and become sizeable
that all the roots of what is wholesome of all sentient beings grow and become sizeable whether it is the roots of what is wholesome of those on the vehicle of the hearers on the pratyekabuddha vehicle or on the great vehicle
however manjusri the tathagata does not form mental constructs or concepts
or of all tirthikas such as the carakas parivrajakas and nirgranthas and so forth or of any others down to the roots of what is wholesome of those stuck in what is wrong it is through having the tathagata as their basis and support that they grow and become sizeable
manjusri the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha has cut off all mental constructs concepts points of reference and mental engagement
he is free from mind mentality and consciousness
he is neither speculation nor the domain of speculation
he is invisible
not to be beheld
not an object of thought or deliberation
free from thought
it is free from mind mentality and consciousness
with respect to all he is the same neutral without concepts and he does not make any distinctions
it is as follows manjusri
space is everywhere the same
free from concepts
and distinctions
it is nonarisen
and unceasing
it is not past future or present
it is indefinable
nonelaborate
and formless
it cannot be shown
or made known
it is without contact
without dwelling
not comparable
and beyond compare
it has no simile
and is beyond all similes
it has no basis
it is ungraspable
and beyond visible range
it has no characteristic
it is without syllables voice and mental engagement
manjusri sentient beings experience space as being low or high according to whether the place is low middling or high
it is beyond the realm of words
it reaches and enters everywhere and still
it has no striving or giving up
no removal
no addition
he is without mental engagement
in the same way manjusri the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha is everywhere the same free from concepts and distinctions
manjusri sentient beings experience space as being low or high according to whether the place is low middling or high
he is nonarisen
and unceasing
he is not past future or present
he is indefinable
nonelaborate
and formless
he cannot be shown or made known
he is without contact
without dwelling
not comparable
and beyond compare
he has no simile
and is beyond all similes
he has no basis
he is ungraspable
and beyond visible range
he is free from mind mentality and consciousness
he has no characteristic
he is without syllables voice and mental engagement
he reaches and enters everywhere
he is beyond the realm of words
and still manjusri according to whether sentient beings are low middling or high
they see the tathagata as low middling or high
manjusri the tathagata does not think
this sentient being has low inclinations and beliefs so i will show him a low perfection of the form body
this sentient being has middling inclinations and beliefs so i will show him a middling perfection of the form body
this sentient being has vast inclinations and beliefs
so i will show him a vast perfection of the form body
manjusri this is also what you should understand regarding how the dharma is taught
so for him i shall make a speech relating to the hearers vehicle
manjusri the tathagata does not think this sentient being has low beliefs
this sentient being has middling beliefs
so for him i shall make a speech relating to the pratyekabuddha vehicle
no removal
no addition
he has no striving or giving up
so for him i shall make a speech relating to the pratyekabuddha vehicle
this sentient being has vast beliefs
so for him i shall make a speech relating to the great vehicle
manjusri the tathagata does not think this sentient being has belief in giving
so for him i shall make a speech related to giving
nor does he think so for discipline forbearance diligence or concentration
manjusri the tathagata is the dharmakaya
manjusri the tathagata is utterly nonarisen
manjusri for the tathagata a consciousness chasing after names forms and etymological explanations does not occur
manjusri the tathagata does not form mental constructs or concepts
manjusri the tathagata is momentary
manjusri the tathagata does not think this sentient being has belief in the perfection of wisdom so for him i shall make a speech related to the perfection of wisdom
manjusri the tathagata does not think in that way
and his characteristic is to be inexhaustible
he is fixed at the pinnacle of nonexhaustion the pinnacle of reality
manjusri the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha
is the pinnacle of the sameness of all dharmas the pinnacle of their nonduality and the pinnacle of their utter nonarising
he is not low nor middling nor high
in all regards he is the same free from concepts and free from distinctions
they are not low nor middling nor high
it is because no dharmas are perceived
manjusri just in the same way all dharmas are same free from concepts and free from distinctions
and why is that
manjusri this nonperception of all dharmas is their sameness
manjusri this nonperception of all dharmas is their sameness
their sameness is their remaining fixed
remaining fixed means that they do not move
not moving means being without any abode
for someone with no abode in any dharma the mind has no place to stand
for a mind that stands nowhere there will be nonarising
and for someone who sees in this way no distorted mind and mental states come about
someone whose mind is undistorted will have authentic attainment
whoever has authentic attainment will not form elaborations
someone who does not form elaborations does not move about
when one does not move about one does not wander
when one does not wander one does not become distracted
one who does not become distracted does not oppose the dharmata
one who does not oppose the dharmata is in conformity with everything
one who is in conformity with everything does not move from the nature of the dharmas
one who does not move from the nature of the dharmas obtains the nature of the dharmas
one who obtains the nature of the dharmas does not form any elaboration
why is that
whoever is born from conditions and causes is utterly unborn
someone utterly unborn has gained certainty
whoever has gained certainty does not dwell with any mental engagement in the dharmas
when one does not dwell with any mental engagement in the dharmas one does not dwell with the dharmas
when one does not dwell with the dharmas one does not come into existence or go out of existence
when one does not come into existence or go out of existence one becomes fixed and has obtained the dharma
when one becomes fixed and has obtained the dharma one applies oneself to the proper dharma
when one applies oneself to the proper dharma no dharma whatsoever is not a buddhadharma
due to the realization of emptiness
the realization of emptiness is awakening
nosign
nowish
nodwelling
noeffort
it is awakening because in this way one realizes emptiness nosign nowish noeffort nodwelling no coming about no object of apprehension and noabode
awakening is proper application
what is called proper application is to neither remove nor add
and why
and the application of what has yet to come
this is proper application
it is the nonliberated application
and it is not connected
it is the application of not doing and not changing
the application of neither oneness nor plurality
because mind is by nature luminous
in that respect there is no application
no measure
and no direct realization of a result
it is afflicted by adventitious afflictions
but its nature is not afflicted
luminosity by nature is nonaffliction
with respect to nonaffliction there is no counteragenta counteragent by which the destruction of the afflictions may occur
because what is pure does not become pure it just is pure
that which is pure is nonarising
nonarising is faultless
what is faultless is the destruction of joys
whereby all attachments cease
where all attachments cease that is nonarising
and nonarising is awakening
awakening is sameness
sameness is the tathata
all dharmas coproduced and unproduced abide in the tathata
there is no designation of duality
with respect to the tathata there is neither something coproduced
where there is nothing coproduced or unproduced and no designation of duality that is the tathata
nor something unproduced
the tathata is nothing else but the tathata
nothing else but the tathata is the unchanging tathata
the unchanging tathata is the noncoming tathata
the unchanging tathata is the noncoming tathata
the noncoming tathata is the tathata that does not go
the tathata that does not go is the authentic tathata
the authentic tathata is the notatalltathata
the notatalltathata is not afflicted
and is not purified
that which is neither afflicted nor purified neither arises nor ceases
that which neither arises nor ceases is the same as nirvana
that which is the same as nirvana neither roams within samsara nor passes into complete nirvana
that which neither roams within samsara nor passes into complete nirvana is not past future or present
that which is not past future or present is not low middling or high
that which is not low middling or high is the tathata
what we call tathatha is an expression meaning tattva
what we call tattva is tathata itself
tathata being the same as tattva is called tathatva
thus the tathata and the self are not two they are nondual
the meaning of nonduality is awakening in the sense of becoming awake
the meaning is explained as the awareness that enters the three gates of liberation with respect to all the dharma teachings
the awareness is explained as engaging in the sameness of the three times with respect to all dharmas
the meaning of the inseparability of all dharmas is what is explained as the meaning
it is voiceless
ineffable
inexpressible
and cut off from any expressions
awareness is explained as the awareness that understands the meaning and understands consciousness
this is explained as awareness
the meaning is explained as the meaning that is established by the awareness that understands the meaning of tattva and by the awareness that understands consciousness
that itself is the dharmata
and the dharmata is the meaning
sameness is the meaning
manjusri for those who have attachment to form the eye is attachment
knowing the nature of form and of the eye is nonattachment
for those who have attachment to views ones own body is attachment
for those who have done away with all views the awareness of ones bodys natural emptiness is nonattachment
for those who are stuck in their attachment to improper mental placement the appearance of dharmas is attachment
discerning the dharmas through proper mental placement the awareness of emptiness by nature and emptiness of essence is nonattachment
for those who are stuck in their attachment to the stain of doubt liberation is attachment
the authentic awareness of belief and liberation is nonattachment
for those who are stuck in their attachment to the stain of laziness having present diligence toward realization is attachment
the realization of dharmas as they are is nonattachment
the realization of dharmas as they are is nonattachment
for those who are stuck in their attachment to the hindrances the limbs of awakening are attachment
liberation through unobstructed awareness is nonattachment
being by nature completely pure all dharmas occur due to an assemblage of causes and conditions
the sameness of the interpretable meaning and the definitive meaning is their common meaning which is emptiness
because he is born due to conditions and causes
the sameness of liberation is the same as the sameness of the dharmas
realization according to the sameness of liberation is awakening
the sameness of the person is the same as the common meaning
the sameness of the dharmas is the same as the sameness of persons
it is sameness according to the understanding of the meaning it is the sameness of awareness entering the gate of nonduality
the nonoccurrence of the dharma and the sameness of meaning and expression are the same with respect to the nondual meaning
with respect to that a bodhisattva should understand well the cause of affliction and the cause of purification
he should neither abide with the purity of the cause of affliction nor with the purity of the cause of purification
elevating self is a cause of affliction
forbearance in ones engagement with the selflessness of dharmas is a cause of purification
the view of i and mine is a cause of affliction
inner pacification and outer nonmovement is a cause of purification
thoughts of desire ill will and harm are a cause of affliction
emptiness
it is awakening because in this way one realizes emptiness nosign nowish noeffort nodwelling no coming about no object of apprehension and noabode
forbearance in ones dealings with impure things in ones practice of friendliness compassion rejoicing equanimity and with dependent dharmas is a cause of purification
the four distortions are a cause of affliction
the four placements of mindfulness are a cause of purification
the five hindrances are a cause of affliction
the five faculties are a cause of purification
the six entrances are a cause of affliction
the six remembrances are a cause of purification
the seven false dharmas are a cause of affliction
the seven limbs of awakening are a cause of purification
the eight wrong modes are a cause of affliction
the eight right modes are a cause of purification
the nine causes of antagonism are a cause of affliction
the absorptions into nine successive abodes are a cause of purification
the ten unwholesome courses of karma are a cause of affliction
the ten wholesome courses of karma are a cause of purification
in brief all unwholesome mental engagements are a cause of affliction
all wholesome mental engagements are a cause of purification
without a sentient being
without a living being
without one who nourishes
without a soul or a person
without a master
without activity
comparable to an illusion without characteristics
pacified from within
in that respect whether causes of affliction or of purification all dharmas are by nature empty
pacified from within they are utterly pacified
utterly pacified they are their intrinsic nature
their intrinsic nature is not being perceived
not being perceived is to have no abode
that which has no abode is thatness
thatness is space
and why
one cognizes all dharmas as the same as space one engages conventionally in the purification of afflictions yet does not abandon the dharmata of space
manjusri no dharma whatsoever can be found for which there may be arising or cessation
manjusri inquired
how then bhagavat did the tathagata obtain awakening
the bhagavat replied
manjusri the tathagata obtained an awakening that has no root and no ground to stand upon
manjusri asked
bhagavat what root would that be
and what ground to stand upon
manjusri that root would be the transitory collection
and that ground to stand upon the imagination of what is not there
then manjusri the tathagata knows the sameness of all dharmas through the sameness of awakening
therefore it is said manjusri that the tathagata realized an awakening that has no root and no ground to stand upon
awakening manjusri is to be at peace utterly at peace
in that respect what is peace
what is utter peace
inside there is peace
outside there is utter peace
why is that
the eye manjusri is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
such is its nature this is called peace
thoroughly understanding that the eye is empty one does not run toward forms
thus it is called utter peace
in the same way the ear is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
thoroughly understanding that the ear is empty one does not run toward sounds
the nose is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
thoroughly understanding that the nose is empty
one does not run toward smells
the tongue is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
thoroughly understanding that the tongue is empty one does not run toward flavors
the body is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
thoroughly understanding that the body is empty
one does not run toward touchable things
the mind manjusri is empty of a self and what belongs to a self
thoroughly understanding that the mind is empty
one does not run toward dharmas
the nature is not afflicted
awakening manjusri is by nature luminous because the mind is by nature luminous that is why it is said to be luminous by nature
it is the same as space
it has the nature of space
it goes together with space
it is comparable to space
the nature is utterly luminous
awakening manjusri is without striving or giving anything up
in that respect how is it without striving
and how is it without giving anything up
without striving means not to grasp at any dharma
without striving means not to grasp at any dharma
without giving anything up means not to abandon any dharma
in that respect manjusri the tathagata without striving or giving anything up crossed the stream
he crossed it in such a way that he does not see this shore or the other shore of tathata
thus he is called the tathagata
therefore the tathagata realized all dharmas to be free from this shore or the other shore
awakening manjusri is without sign or reference point
in that respect what is signlessness and what is the lack of reference point
that the eyeconsciousness does not perceive manjusri is signlessness
that form is not seen is the lack of reference point
that the earconsciousness does not perceive is signlessness
that sounds are not heard is the lack of reference point
that the noseconsciousness does not perceive is signlessness
that smells are not smelt is the lack of reference point
that the tongueconsciousness does not perceive is signlessness
that the bodyconsciousness does not perceive is signlessness
that touchable things are not touched is the lack of reference point
that the mindconsciousness does not perceive is signlessness
that dharmas are not cognized is the lack of reference point
this manjusri is the scope of the noble ones
that which is not the scope of the three realms manjusri is the scope of the noble ones
awakening manjusri is not past not future not present
that flavors are not tasted is the lack of reference point
it is the same in the three times and is cut off from the three spheres
in that respect manjusri what does it mean to be cut off from the three spheres
the mind in the past is not perceived
consciousness does not run toward the future
consciousness does not run toward the future
mental placement does not occur in the present
one who does not abide in mind mentality and consciousness does not form mental constructs or concepts
one does not elaborate about the present
not forming mental constructs or concepts one does not create the past
does not think of the future
awakening manjusri is bodiless and unproduced
in that respect manjusri bodilessness is what cannot be cognized by the eye consciousness
what cannot be cognized by the ear nose tongue body or mind consciousness
manjusri that which cannot be cognized by mind mentality and consciousness is unproduced
no abiding
the unproduced is explained this way where there is no arising
no passing away
that is called the unproduced purified of the three spheres
and why
the coproduced should be understood just like the unproduced
the essence of all dharmas is noessence
in that respect there is no duality
awakening manjusri is a basis of nondivision
in that respect what is nondivision
hat is the basis
nonotion is nondivision
the tathata is the basis
nogroundtostandupon is nondivision
the dharmadhatu is the basis
nonmultiplicity is nondivision
emptiness is nondivision
the true limit is the basis
nonapprehension is nondivision
nonmovement is the basis
nosign is the basis
nondeliberation is nondivision
nowish is the basis
being without a sentient being is the basis
nonessence of a sentient being is nondivision
space is the basis
nonperception is nondivision
nonarising is the basis
noncessation is nondivision
the unproduced is the basis
the unproduced is the basis
no moving about is nondivision
awakening is the basis
pacification is nondivision
nirvana is the basis
nondevelopment is nondivision
nonbirth is the basis
and why
awakening manjusri is not realized by the body
nor by the mind
the body manjusri is inert motionless and insentient
it is similar and comparable to grass logs of wood walls or clay
the mind on the other hand can be compared to an illusion
it is hollow void unreal and unproduced
manjusri to realize the body and mind in this manner is explained as awakening
this is based on conventional usage but it is not in the ultimate sense
manjusri awakening cannot be explained in terms of the body the mind or dharma nondharma real unreal truth or falsity
awakening manjusri cannot be expressed through any dharma
manjusri awakening does not have the slightest location that allows it to enter conventional usage
in the same way manjusri awakening has no location
space has no location
it is unproduced
nonarisen
unceasing
cannot be expressed
manjusri when searching for the real space it cannot be explained through any dharma
manjusri when searching for the real awakening it cannot be explained through any dharma
manjusri with respect to what is real no words can be found because it is nonarisen and unceasing
awakening manjusri means to be ungraspable and to have no abode
in that respect manjusri what is it to be ungraspable
what is it to have no abode
what is it to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the eye manjusri is to be ungraspable
the nonperception of form is to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the ear is to be ungraspable
the nonperception of sound is to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the nose is to be ungraspable
the nonperception of smell is to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the tongue is to be ungraspable
the nonperception of flavor is to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the body is to be ungraspable
the nonperception of touchable things is to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the mind is to be ungraspable
the nonperception of dharmas is to have no abode
in this way the tathagata has realized awakening ungraspable and without abode
the eyeconsciousness has no ground to stand upon
not grasping at the ear and
not perceiving sounds the earconsciousness has no ground to stand upon
not grasping at the nose and
not perceiving smells the noseconsciousness has no ground to stand upon
not grasping at the body and
not perceiving touchable things the bodyconsciousness has no ground to stand upon
not grasping at the mind and
not perceiving dharmas the mindconsciousness has no ground to stand upon
therefore as his consciousness has no ground to stand upon he comes to be counted as the tathagata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha
manjusri there are four grounds for the minds of sentient beings to stand upon
which four
form is a ground for the mind of sentient beings to stand upon
similarly
manjusri feeling notion and coproducing factors are grounds for the minds of sentient beings to stand upon
manjusri these four grounds for the mind to stand upon are known by the tathagata to be nonarisen and unceasing
manjusri these four grounds for the mind to stand upon are known by the tathagata to be nonarisen and unceasing
awakening manjusri is an appellation for emptiness
manjusri the emptiness by which awakening is empty is also the emptiness by which all dharmas are empty
and the tathagata realized them precisely in the way in which they are empty
manjusri it is not that emptiness is realized through emptiness
there is one single method emptiness or awakening
and why
manjusri where there is no emptiness there is no awakening
in that respect manjusri there is no duality by which emptiness and awakening could be made into two
manjusri all dharmas are nondual
without characteristics not made into two
without names
without signs
free from mind mentality and consciousness
nonarisen
unceasing
not acting
not moving forth
not occurring
without syllables
without speech
manjusri that which is called empty is an appellation for no attachment and no grasping
on the other hand manjusri in the ultimate sense no dharma called empty is there to be perceived
on the other hand manjusri
the sky is called sky yet the sky cannot be expressed
in the same way manjusri we say empty empty as an entrance to inexpressible empty things
all dharmas are nameless
yet all dharmas are described through names
manjusri a name is not placed in either a primary or an intermediate location
without characteristics
thus manjusri all the dharmas are known by the tathagata to be from the very beginning unborn nonarisen
free from mind mentality and consciousness
without syllables
without voice
they are known to be just free
it is not that they are first bound and then freed
awakening manjusri is the same as the sky
the sky is neither even nor uneven
awakening too is neither even nor uneven
and why
manjusri a dharma with no real perfection cannot be spoken of as either even or uneven
therefore manjusri all dharmas are realized by the tathagata as neither even nor uneven
they are realized in such a way that not even an atom is made even or uneven
dharmas are cognized just as they are
and how does that accord with the awareness of reality
manjusri all dharmas nonarisen and unceasing come into being after having not existed
just like awakening so also feeling notion coproducing factors and consciousness do not swerve from the tathata
in that respect manjusri what is a consistent basis
manjusri just like awakening so also form does not swerve from the tathata
in this way manjusri they come into existence and go out of existence
thus it is said that the tathagata teaches the dharma for the sake of cutting off the dharmas
awakening manjusri is a consistent basis
just like awakening so also feeling notion coproducing factors and consciousness do not swerve from the tathata
just like awakening so also the earth element does not swerve from the tathata
just like awakening so also the water element
the heat element
the wind element do not swerve from the tathata
just like awakening so also the eyebase
the eyeconsciousnessbase do not swerve from the tathata
just like awakening manjusri the earbase
the soundbase
the earconsciousnessbase
the nosebase
the smellbase
the noseconsciousnessbase
the tonguebase
the flavorbase
the tongueconsciousnessbase
the bodybase
the touchablebase
the bodyconsciousnessbase
the mindbase
the dharmabase
the mindconsciousnessbase do not swerve from the tathata
and dharmas can be designated
just as this the aggregates
the bases and
the entrances
and this entire set has been realized by the tathagata as consistent
as it is before so also is it later and in between
it is unborn in the prior limit
not transferred at the later limit and
isolated in the middle
in this way for all those things there is a consistent basis
just as one is so are all
just as all are so is one
and in this respect manjusri neither oneness nor plurality is perceived
awakening manjusri enters the aspectless by entering an aspect
in that respect manjusri what is an aspect and what is the aspectless
the aspect manjusri is explained as taking up all wholesome dharmas
the aspectless is explained as the nonperception of any dharmas
the aspect is explained as the stabilization of an unstable mind
the aspectless is explained as the gate to liberation of the samadhi of nosign
the aspectless is explained as the gate to liberation of the samadhi of nosign
the aspect is explained as thinking comparing counting and thorough consideration of all dharmas
the aspectless is explained as transcending comparison
what is transcending comparison
it is that with respect to which there is no function of consciousness
the aspect is explained as the thorough consideration of the coproduced
the aspectless is explained as the thorough consideration of the unproduced
awakening manjusri is without outflows and without clinging
in that respect manjusri how is it without outflows and how is it without clinging
being without outflows manjusri is explained as the absence of the four outflows
which four
they are the outflow of desire
the outflow of existence
the outflow of views
the outflow of ignorance and
being without clinging is explained as the absence of four types of clinging
they are clinging to desire
clinging to views
clinging to positing a self
clinging to ones attachment to discipline and vows and
beings are blinded by ignorance
craving disturbs them
they develop mutual attachment and cling to each other
in that respect manjusri the tathagata thoroughly understands that the root of clinging is the position of a self
through selfpurity he understands the purity of all sentient beings
the purity of self is the purity of all sentient beings the purity of all sentient beings is nondual not divided into two
and the meaning of nonduality is nonarising and noncessation
with respect to nonarising and noncessation manjusri mind mentality and consciousness do not come about
in that respect there is no mental construct by which one may place the mind improperly
in that respect there is no mental construct by which one may place the mind improperly
whosoever engages in proper mental placement does not give rise to ignorance
not giving rise to ignorance means not giving rise to the twelve limbs of existence
not giving rise to the twelve limbs of existence means no birth
no birth is the fixed rule
the fixed rule is the definitive meaning
the definitive meaning is the ultimate meaning
the ultimate meaning means to be devoid of a person
the meaning of being devoid of a person is the ineffable meaning
the ineffable meaning is the meaning of dependent arising
the meaning of dependent arising is the meaning of the dharma
the meaning of the dharma is the meaning of the tathagata
hence it is said one who sees dependent arising sees the dharma
one who sees the dharma sees the tathagata
and he sees in such a way that when he searches he does not see anything whatsoever
awakening manjusri is pure stainless and without disturbance
in that respect manjusri what is purity what is meant by stainless and what is nondisturbance
emptiness manjusri is purity
nosign is stainless
nowish is nondisturbance
nonbirth is purity
noneffort is stainless
nonarising is nondisturbance
the nature is purity
complete purity is stainless
luminosity is nondisturbance
no elaboration is purity
freedom from elaboration is stainless
the pacification of elaborations is nondisturbance
in this way the tathagata has realized through their very sameness that all these dharmas are equal
when one does not see the mind and the point of reference one then sees reality
the pacification of elaborations is nondisturbance
the tathata is purity
the dharmadhatu is stainless
the pinnacle of reality is nondisturbance
space is purity
the sky is stainless
the atmosphere is nondisturbance
to thoroughly cognize inside is purity
not to move forth on the outside is stainless
nonperception inside and outside is nondisturbance
to thoroughly cognize the aggregates is purity
the essencelessness of the bases is stainless
putting away the entrances is nondisturbance
to cognize past destruction is purity
to cognize future nonarising is stainless
to cognize the present abiding of the dharmadhatu is nondisturbance
in this way manjusri purity the stainless and nondisturbance are collected within a single basis
the peaceful basis
that which is peaceful is very peaceful
that which is very peaceful is utterly peaceful
that which is utterly peaceful is utter pacification
utter pacification is called the sage
thus manjusri just like space so is awakening
just like awakening so are the dharmas
just like the dharmas so are sentient beings
just like sentient beings so are the fields
just like the fields so is nirvana
therefore manjusri it is said that all dharmas are the same as nirvana
since this is their ultimate mode there is no counteragent
because there is no counteragent they are primordially pure
primordially stainless and
primordially without disturbances
it is thus manjusri that the tathagata realized all dharmas to be as he observes the sphere of sentient beings a pure great compassion that is free from disturbances called play comes about toward those sentient beings
manjusri how does a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva
manjusri how does a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva
nor is he disturbed by utter nonarising
manjusri a bodhisattva does not think of destruction arising nondestruction nonarising and the utter destruction of destruction
and why
manjusri a bodhisattva may practice thinking that form is not empty and also not nonempty
form itself is empty of the essence of form
furthermore manjusri a bodhisattva does not practice by thinking the past mind is destroyed
manjusri a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
manjusri giving awakening and sentient beings and on the other hand the tathagata these are nondual
they are not divided into two practicing in this way a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
manjusri discipline awakening and sentient beings and on the other hand the tathagata these are nondual they are not divided into two practicing in this way a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
practicing in this way manjusri that bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva
n the same way feeling notion coproducing factors and consciousness are empty he practices thinking in this way and also thinking that they are not nonempty
in the same way feeling notion coproducing factors and consciousness are empty he practices thinking in this way and also thinking that they are not nonempty
and why
because mind mentality and consciousness are not perceived manjusri there is no dharma whatsoever that could be thoroughly cognized dispelled cultivated or directly realized
manjusri that which is understood as destruction is simply the destruction of extremes
as it is indestructible and not destroyed it is without destruction
and that which is completely destroyed is not something one should cause to be destroyed
it conforms to destruction
conforming to destruction is the destruction of nothing whatsoever
and that wherein there is no destruction of anything whatsoever is unproduced
with respect to the unproduced there is no arising
and no cessation
therefore it is said whether the tathagatas arise or not
this dharmata is invariable it is the invariability of the dharmas the dharmadhatu
just like the invariability of the dharmadhatu the tathagatas awareness is neither occurring nor ceasing
the destruction of the outflows manjusri is a conventional expression speech syllables sign and designation
here no dharma whatsoever arises or ceases
then the youthful manjusri rose from his seat
folded his upper robe
placed his right knee on the ground
folding his hands in the direction of the bhagavat
he praised him with these verses
you have no color sign or shape
you are free of any point of reference i bow to you
you have no ground to stand upon
no striving or giving up
you are not situated in any dharma
bereft of existence or nonexistence
you obtained the sameness of coproducing factors
free from the three world spheres
you have attained the skys own sameness
you are not defiled by desires
no root and no ground to stand upon
no cessation or origination
entering the dharma method in this way the outflows do not arise and do not cease
he does not practice by thinking the present mind abides
he does not practice by thinking the future mind has yet to be obtained
he is not stuck in the past future or present mind as he practices in this way
the tathagata diligence awakening and sentient beings and
the tathagata
awakening and sentient beings and
these are nondual they are not divided into two
you always remain in samadhi
whichever your posture may be
as you move stand or lie down
you arrive evenly and go evenly
remaining well placed in sameness
you are not disturbed at sameness
you are absorbed in sameness
in samadhi within all dharmas
absorbed in the signless
unplaced without point of reference
your samadhi is the peak of wisdom
you have become the lord of dharma
you are free of any point of reference i bow to you
free from the six entrances
in one instant you see the forms voices and postures of all sentient beings
free from name and form
you cut off all causes and aggregates
you are the entrance into the aspectless
you are free from signs
and bereft of their aspects
you are the entrance into the signless
you do not form concepts
your mind has no ground to stand upon
you have no recollection or mental placement
space is without abode
it is free from elaboration and stainless
your mind is the same as space
space is without edge or center
so too is the dharmata of the buddhas
you have gone beyond the three times
you have gone beyond the three times
the buddhas have the characteristic of space
and space has no characteristics
you are free from effect and cause
you cannot be grasped
like the moon in the water
you are not placed in any dharma
free from the two extremes
you cut off the view of self
you obtained sameness with the dharmadhatu
you are free from form and number
you are not dwelling in the aggregates the bases or the entrances
you are free from distortions
bereft of any false dharmas
you neither cling to nor abandon
you have gone beyond the faults of mara

you have the feature of nonobscuration
those who understand the meaning do not say he exists or he does not
you are not in the realm of words
not relying on duality
you are free from duality and nonduality
you cut down the banner of pride
you are inconceivable without compare
you have subdued all mental flaws and the four flaws of the body
you conduct yourself effortlessly
you are bereft of any flaws
awareness precedes all your actions
your recollection has no outflows
it is subtle and conforms to what is real and unreal
you have no abode and no thoughts
with your mind free of a point of reference
you understand well the mind of all
while having no notion of self and others
you remain unobscured
makes everyones mind bewildered
taking up points of reference
you are free of any point of reference i bow to you
a mind without point of reference
cannot essentially be found
you obtained inconceivable sameness
with your unplaced awareness
you see all the fields
and the conduct of all beings
you know everything about all dharmas
the buddhas do not apprehend the mind in any way ever
illusionlike are all dharmas
yet the illusion itself cannot be found
you are free from the dharma of illusion
perfect buddha you act in the world
not dwelling upon worldly dharmas
you do not form concepts about the world
you declare what is empty as empty
you are absorbed into freedom from multiplicity
through great powers and illusory samadhi you perform miracles
you are neither one nor many
you are neither far nor near
you neither remove nor add
through the diamondlike samadhi
you obtained supreme awakening in one instant
you are absorbed into nonappearance
you know nirvana to be unmoving in the three times
you are a guide endowed with many methods
you know nirvana to be unmoving
you are expert in understanding which methods
you are free from signs effortless
free from elaboration and untainted
free from appearance free from a self
you are omniscient with respect to everything
you yourself know the self as it is
free from concepts free from what belongs to a self
you are free of any point of reference i bow to you
i salute you who have ten powers and have crossed the stream
i salute you the fearless one who bestows fearlessness
you obtained certainty in the unshared dharmas
guide for the entire world i salute you
i salute you who break the bondage of fetters
i salute you who reached the other shore and remain on dry ground
i salute you guide for the exhausted world
i salute you who go to samsara and remain unplaced
sage buddha you practiced emptiness
you are untainted like a lotus by the waters it grows in
i salute you who are free from a point of reference and crossed the great stream
isolation is the unexcelled state of the teacher
i salute the inconceivable buddha of great power who is the same as space and without abode
you have thoroughly eliminated all signs and you wish for nothing whatsoever
i salute you supreme holder of all good qualities
i salute you whose glory rises up like meru
then the bhagavat praised the youthful manjusri
good manjusri that is good
you have spoken well manjusri
it is just as you said
manjusri the buddhas should not be seen through form through dharmas through characteristics or through the dharmadhatu
the buddhas do not stay by themselves
nor do they reside among many people
the buddhas have not been seen by anyone nor heard nor worshipped nor are they being worshipped now
the buddhas did not obtain awakening
the buddhas do not make oneness or plurality out of any dharma
the buddhas are not increased by any dharma
no dharma has been seen by the buddhas nor has it been heard recollected cognized or known
no dharma has been seen by the buddhas nor has it been heard recollected cognized or known
the buddhas have not spoken or expressed anything
they do not speak or express anything
they will not speak or express anything
the buddhas do not gain supreme realization
the buddhas do not supremely realize any dharma
the buddhas afflictions have not been destroyed
buddhas have not directly realized purification
buddhas have not seen any dharma nor heard it smelt it tasted it touched it or cognized it
and why
because of the primordial purity of all dharmas
such a person engenders even more merit
all the more so for one who writes down this dharma teaching or makes others write it
manjusri there are many sentient beings to be found in the great trichiliocosm whether born from an egg
born from a womb
born from moisture
born suddenly
some with form others formless
some with notions others without notions
some without feet others with two feet
some with four feet or with many feet now imagine that all of them obtain a human body without precedent but not their last
once they obtain a human body they give rise to bodhicitta
having given rise to bodhicitta
each and every one of those bodhisattvas attends as many buddhas together with bodhisattvas and hearers
as there are atomic particles in buddhafields as numerous as the grains of sand in the ganges
he collects all the necessities for their happiness
offers robes almsfood bedding seats herbs that counteract illness and provisions
for as many eons as the number of grains of sand in the ganges
pearls
with raised umbrellas standards and flags
now imagine another bodhisattva with the right inclination who listens to this dharma teaching the ornament of the light of awareness that enters the domain of all buddhas and then believes in it engages with it trusts it
realizes it or teaches at least one of its stanzas compared to the bodhisattvas first mentioned he would engender even more uncountable merit that would lead him to follow the awareness of a buddha
compared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
it would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of it it would not even count as any part any number worthy of consideration simile or approximation of any kind
manjusri imagine a householder bodhisattva who attends as many buddhas and bodhisattvas
together with their sangha of hearers as there are grains of sand in the ganges for eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the ganges
he would offer them robes almsfood bedding seats remedies for exhaustion medicinal herbs and provisions
another ordained bodhisattva disciplined and with the right inclination may give a morsel of food to a single sentient being born as an animal
another ordained bodhisattva disciplined and with the right inclination may give a morsel of food to a single sentient being born as an animal
compared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth part
together with their sangha of hearers as there are grains of sand in the ganges he would offer robes almsfood bedding seats remedies for exhaustion medicinal herbs and provisions for eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the ganges
manjusri imagine as many bodhisattvas as there are atomic particles in the great trichiliocosm all of them ordained disciplined and pure in their inclinations each bodhisattva would attend as many buddhas and bodhisattvas
compared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
it would not even bear approximation of any kind
it would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of it
it would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of it
offer it as a gift to the buddhas the bhagavats
manjusri imagine that a bodhisattva great being were to fill the great trichiliocosm with seven precious substances and
but another bodhisattva may teach just a fourline stanza from this dharma method to another bodhisattva
compared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth part
it would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of it
it would not even bear approximation of any kind
manjusri consider that the production of merit of someone giving offerings were to continue for as many eons as there are atomic particles in a great trichiliocosm
manjusri bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in the ganges would be there
each bodhisattva would cover as many golden buddhafields as the number of grains of sand in the ganges
all their trees with divine clothes and then cover them in nets of gems and jewels shining in all possible ways
he would then fill them with high palaces made of precious vasiraja gems
surrounded with vedikas of the precious vidyutpradipa gems once filled he would give them as a gift with raised parasols standards and flags to as many buddhas as there are grains of sand in the ganges each and every day
it is as follows manjusri if all sentient beings included in the three world spheres were to be born in the hells or as animals or as pretas in the world of yama
it is as follows manjusri if all sentient beings included in the three world spheres were to be born in the hells or as animals or as pretas in the world of yama
a householder bodhisattva may pull all of them out from those hells the animal realm and the preta world of yama and establish them in the state of a pratyekabuddha
but another ordained bodhisattva may just give a morsel of food to one sentient being born as an animal
compared to the first the second would engender a greater merit an uncountably greater merit
by not grasping at the eye and not perceiving form
the formbase and
manjusri a bodhisattva may establish as many sentient beings as there are atomic particles in a great trichiliocosm into the state of a pratyekabuddha but he may still have no belief in this dharma teaching
another bodhisattva manjusri who believes in this dharma teaching
engenders much more merit than the first
all those bodhisattvas would thus produce merit through their acts of giving
but another bodhisattva pure in his inclinations and disciplined whether householder or ordained
offering in this way he would give this gift for as many eons as there are atomic particles of dust in a great trichiliocosm
but another bodhisattva may teach just a fourline stanza from this dharma method to another bodhisattva
in this way he would offer such gifts for eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the ganges
but another bodhisattva may believe in this dharma teaching and
teach just a single fourfoot stanza from it to another bodhisattva
compared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
he would then attend upon each tathagata and the corresponding bodhisattvas and hearers for as many eons as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous tens of quintillions of buddhafields
he would offer robes almsfood bedding seats remedies for exhaustion medicinal herbs and provisions
compared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
and why
it would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of it it would not even count as any part any number worthy of consideration simile or approximation of any kind
the seal of nonreturning bodhisattvas is to hear this dharma teaching
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows out of conviction
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of one who follows the meaning
in that case the latter would engender incalculably greater merit
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows the meaning
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of one who follows the dharma
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows the dharma
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of attaining the stream
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of attaining the stream
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of a oncereturner
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a oncereturner
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of a nonreturner
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a nonreturner
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of an arhat
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of an arhat
in that case the latter would engender incalculably greater merit
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of an arhat
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of a pratyekabuddha
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a pratyekabuddha
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in bodhicitta
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in bodhicitta
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of irreversibility
manjusri a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of irreversibility
at least cause a single sentient being to engage with this dharma teaching
another bodhisattva believing in this dharma teaching might make others write it down might shed light on it
then at that time the bhagavat spoke the following verses
if another listens with reverence to this sutra
in the final times of decay a bodhisattva may uphold the good dharma of a hundred million buddhas
his merit will be great and exceed the former
eliciting compassion not craving for any pleasure
he may then salute all of those sacred persons
if for just a brief moment another teaches others this sutra
will have sharp wisdom and great strength
the fruit of his merit will exceed the former
keeps his mind well disposed toward the sugatas teaching
quickly reach the level of the buddhas
have attained complete nirvana without any remainder
this was translated edited and finalized by the indian scholar surendrabodhi the translatoreditor bhande yeshe de and others
he may establish tall and beautiful stupas beautified with fine gems to the summit of existence
thus spoke the bhagavat
this completes the noble mahayana sutra the ornament of the light of awareness that enters the domain of all buddhas
here the body of the tathagatas like the spaceelement is shown to all
this sutra is extolled by the sugatas and upheld by many bodhisattvas
his merit will indeed be immeasurable and he shall obtain awakening in accordance with his wish
removing all stains of miserliness and being without fear
if a bodhisattva upholds this dharma
then the fruit of his merit exceeds the former
yet when hearing this very sutra a bodhisattva may form the wish to establish it well either within his body or within a book
with parasols standards and the sound of bells they would rise to the summit of existence
the sugata taught this sutra a lamp for gods and men
each bodhisattva everywhere within the ten directions would then see as many buddhas as many bhagavats as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous tens of quintillions of buddhafields
to each tathagata each and every day he would offer as many world spheres as there are atomic particles in inexpressibly numerous tens of trillions of buddhafields after filling them with the precious vasiraja gems
but another bodhisattva believing in this dharma teaching may give just one morsel of food to a sentient being born as an animal
by using ones own special powers someone may travel through the ten directions
and worship a hundred million buddhas
the noble great vehicle sutra upholding the roots of virtue
homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas
thus did i hear at one time
the blessed one was at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana near rajagrhaan abode for those who practice concentration an abode for those who do not abide an abode for those who dwell in emptiness an abode for those who dwell in signlessness and an abode for those who dwell in wishlessness the blessed one was there together with a great sangha of one hundred thousand monks
all of whom talked only little remained in solitude and diligently practiced meditative seclusion
at one point the venerable saradvatiputra rose from his meditative seclusion and went before the blessed one
he bowed his head to the blessed ones feet and then sat to one side
likewise did the venerable mahamaudgalyayana the venerable mahakatyayana the venerable mahakausthila the venerable kapphina the venerable mahacunda the venerable subhuti the venerable amogharaja the venerable vaspa the venerable nanda the venerable ananda the venerable nandaka the venerable kimbhira the venerable upagupta the venerable narada the venerable vasistha the venerable mokila and the venerable upali along with five hundred others who had all gained mastery they all now rose from their afternoon meditation session and went before the blessed one bowed their heads to his feet and sat to one side
a party including the venerable yasodatta the venerable dhrtarastra the venerable marutpujita the venerable yasaskama the venerable nandisena the venerable nandikama and five hundred other monks had been traveling from sravasti where they had spent the rainy season
now they arrived at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha they also went before the blessed one bowed their heads to his feet and sat to one side
at that time another party consisting of the bodhisattva great being ajita and one thousand bodhisattvas like him were likewise on the way from campa where they had stayed during the rains retreat
when they arrived at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha they also went before the blessed one bowed their heads to his feet and sat to one side
traveling at that time were also the bodhisattva great beings bhadrapala ratnakara susarthavaha guhagupta naradatta indradatta varuna brahmadeva balabhadra visesamati vardhamanamati amoghadarsin susamprasthita suvikrantavikramin nityodyukta aniksiptadhura suryagarbha jagatimdhara dharanimdhara amrtamdhara susthitamati anantamati drdhamati trailokyavikramin anantavikramin aprameyavikramin vajrapadavikramin amoghapadavikramin acalapadavikramin mahapratibhana tiksnapratibhana gambhirapratibhana anantapratibhana aprameyapratibhana manjusrikumarabhuta padmasrigarbha dharmodgata ratnapani ratnadhara bearer of the armor for infinite eons bearer of the armor of female forms bearer of the armor of male forms bearer of the armor of the forms of sentient beings infinite leader unfathomable leader and leader destroying all reference points all these bodhisattva great beings had equally donned the armor of activity and
while they had observed the rains retreat at different locations they were now gathered in one group and so
they also arrived at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha upon their arrival they went before the blessed one bowed their heads to his feet and sat to one side
knowing that this gathering of bodhisattva great beings had assembled the blessed one performed a miraculous feat thus by the doing of the blessed one all the monks and nuns as well as all the male and female lay practitioners who were present near the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by the city of rajagrha now approached the grove and the place where the blessed one was they came there in order to see the blessed one pay him their respect and offer him their worship as they arrived before him they each bowed their heads to the feet of the blessed one and then sat to one side
at that time mahakasyapa was dwelling in the indrasailaguha cave on vaidehaka mountain together with five hundred monks they were all forest dwellers receivers of alms wearers of refuse rags wearers of the three dharma robes upright dwellers users of the grass mat dwellers at the foot of trees men of few desires men of contentment recluses and wearers of inferior dharma robes
now as the blessed one effected his miraculous deed mahakasyapa and the five hundred monks disappeared from the indrasailaguha cave on vaidehaka mountain and emerged at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha such was the blessed ones miraculous activity
perceiving the venerable mahakasyapas arrival from afar the blessed one said to his monks
monks the elder mahakasyapa who has just arrived is a forest dweller a receiver of alms a wearer of refuse rags a wearer of the three dharma robes a wearer of inferior dharma robes a hermit a man of few desires a man of contentment a recluse an incorruptible one and a master of the entire dharma
monks in terms of the ascetic practices all my hearers should be equal or comparable to the monk mahakasyapa
monks since the monk and wearer of the three dharma robes mahakasyapa does not even wish to speak with the gods what need is there to mention his disinterest in human conversation
when the blessed one saw mahakasyapa arriving from afar he said
kasyapa come here be welcome here kasyapa
ah the elder kasyapa has traveled far to be here
take this free seat kasyapa as soon as the blessed one had thus given a seat to the elder kasyapa the blessed one caused a tremor to arise from that seat so that the entire trichiliocosm quivered shivered and trembled vibrated quaked and moved and rattled shook and convulsed at the same time the world became engulfed in a great light
just as a jar of alloyed metal produced in magadha emits a deep reverberating sound when it is struck with an iron hammer so too from the tremor arising from the seat he had just given to the venerable mahakasyapa the thusgone one the worthy one the truly and completely awakened one likewise now caused a great sound to reverberate throughout the entire trichiliocosm
the venerable mahakasyapa then draped his dharma robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee and bowing toward the blessed one joined his palms in respect
he approached the blessed one bowed his head to the blessed ones feet and said
blessed one you are my teacher and i am your hearer thus for us hearers it would not be appropriate to enjoy the dharma robe alms bowl cushion or any other object used by the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha himself
and why is that so
because blessed one for the entire world including its gods humans and demigods these serve as a basis for worship nor blessed one shall i use the refuse rags that the blessed one dons because such garments serve as a basis for the worship of the blessed one
blessed one from now on i shall not entertain any thoughts of desire ill will or malice i shall not bring to mind any of the torments of desire anger or delusion
blessed one in short for as long as i train and until i have reached the ground of no more training i shall place the blessed ones refuse rags at the crown of my head
blessed one such garments i do not receive for my enjoyment but for the sake of practicing the instructions and advice
blessed one as i take up such garments i think myself neither superior nor inferior
blessed one i do not think of the refuse rags as something to be worn on the body in the absence of dharma robes
blessed one i do not think of the refuse rags as something that should be touched by unwashed hands
blessed one wherever i may be i will always prostrate to the refuse rags
blessed one i do not think of the refuse rags as something that should be touched by any unclean limb
blessed one i bear the refuse rags as a basis for worship
blessed one that which i bear is what the blessed one has relinquished and granted
apart from the recollection of the buddhas i do not engage in any attainment for the sake of abiding in some other state
as for the way that i abide i do not identify earth as earth water as water fire as fire or wind as wind i do not have any notion of either this world or something that is beyond it blessed one i do not form any notion about anything seen heard distinguished cognized conceived or contemplated blessed one the state free from perception the state of the attainment free from perception the state of the transcendence of perception the state of the transcendence of freedom from perception the state of perception the state without perception as well as the state of training and the state of no more trainingnone of these do i truly perceive
blessed one within this state i do not perceive any thusgone ones any qualities of the thusgone ones nor any state of the thusgone ones that is how i abide
blessed one take as an analogy the various names signs and designations for open space blessed one in terms of such an application of names signs and designations we may say space and so employ a convention sign or representation blessed one likewise just as we may speak of space we may also say the open the empty the void the hollow the essenceless the ungraspable the limitless the unsupported that which cannot be adopted that which cannot be discarded the bodiless the actual the completely pure midair the unimpeded the insubstantial what cannot be shownor any other such convention nevertheless blessed one no name sign or representation can be employed to successfully delineate determine compare or distinguish space
blessed one wherever we may look we will not find any color shape or objective referent whereby space can be demarcated or contained
similarly blessed one we may say the thusgone one the buddha the teacher the refuge the protector the support the guide the leader the perfect leader the doctor the healer the revealer of the path the teacher of the path or make use of some other name or convention in that way the learned may praise venerate extol laud and applaud the blessed one yet whichever mundane quality they may express through words and conventions in this way this will not make me cognize regard or perceive the blessed one
and why is that so
because blessed one all phenomena are by nature hollow and without essence
blessed one take the analogy of a magician who conjures a universal monarcha king who has received the royal anointment is the master of the four divisions of the army and is in possession of the seven precious treasures
blessed one that magically produced monarch may then be engaged in the subjugation of all the beings that inhabit that universe of four continents and he may succeed in vanquishing that infinite amount of beings
blessed one the monarchs body is distinct and the bodies of the sentient beings are likewise seen as distinct however blessed one the magically conjured universal monarch will certainly not be thinking i shall be the master of this great army i shall rule this world of four continents
and the four divisions of the army will certainly also not be thinking that universal monarch is our leader so we must follow him and yet they do follow him
similarly blessed one that which is the intrinsic nature of phenomena does not exist as a blessed thusgone one a hearer someone training someone not training a solitary buddha or an ordinary being
blessed one within the intrinsic nature there is no observation perception or apprehending of the thusgone ones intrinsic nature there is no observation perception or apprehending of the solitary buddhas intrinsic nature there is no observation perception or apprehending of the hearers intrinsic nature there is no observation perception or apprehending of ordinary beings intrinsic nature there is no observation perception or apprehending of the intrinsic nature of form likewise there is no observation perception or apprehending of the intrinsic nature of feeling perception formation or consciousness
blessed one within the intrinsic nature form is empty form is empty thereby and within that there is no observation of empty form likewise herein feeling perception formation and consciousness are also all empty they are empty thereby and within that there is no observation of them as empty similarly herein the thusgone one is empty the thusgone one is empty thereby and within that there is no observation of the thusgone one as empty in the same way the intrinsic nature of the thusgone one is empty the intrinsic nature of the thusgone one is empty thereby and within that there is no observation of the intrinsic nature of the thusgone one as empty
blessed one in the same way there is no hearer either and no intrinsic nature of the hearer there is no ordinary being and no intrinsic nature of the ordinary being
blessed one in the analogy of the magically produced universal monarch and his divisions of the army there is neither any universal emperor nor any divisions of the army
they are not to be found within the illusion itself the intrinsic nature of the illusion or within the magician
they are not in earth not in water not in fire not in wind not in space and not in consciousness
they are not within the elements of earth water fire wind or space nor are they within the element of consciousness
blessed one all phenomena are this way
blessed one i do not think about them i do not produce them and i do not speak of them
blessed one as i am in this way disengaged from desirable qualities i recollect the qualities of the thusgone ones
blessed one this is the path this is the way
the noble sons and daughters who abide upon and have attained this path will not think i must engage in other trainings i must search for other teachers i shall follow other mendicants or brahmins as they teach that other venerable one knows with insight sees with vision and applies the true view with mastery such thinking is not appropriate
blessed one since i have become certain about this that is how i am
since i have attained that gateway of the dharma that is how i am
this is how all phenomena are they all share the same nature in terms of their voidness and unborn nature
blessed one i wish to bring my doubts about the dharma before the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha and
as the thusgone one has given me the opportunity
i have come here to the kalandakanivapa from the indrasailaguha cave
blessed one i am here and the blessed one has granted me a seat
when he granted me a seat this entire trichiliocosm reverberated and the ground trembled and shook in six ways
blessed one this is how i think the thusgone one is a tremendously great being in possession of the dharma the vast dharma without any master the thusgone one is selfarisen and yet he follows the way of great compassion free of special pride without any pride he has granted me a seat this i find is a wonder
blessed one i think of the analogy of a poor man who has been struggling to maintain the most basic livelihood that man may toil hard and so end up with a fine home
at that point he may go before a king who has received the royal anointment and is the commander of an army of four divisionshe may go before such a king in order to see him prostrate before him pay him respect and ask him questions
if when the man arrives the king then offers him a free seat the man will think
i came here to see the king and pay my respects to him even an opportunity just to see the king and prostrate before him is rare let alone the prospects of being able to ask him questions
still as soon as i arrived this monarch who has received the royal anointment granted me a free seat what a wonder this is
blessed one you are the king of dharma a thusgone one a worthy one a perfect buddha selfarisen and without master how may i wish what even for hearers and solitary buddhas is hard to achieve and hard to imagine let alone for the world of gods humans and demigods
how is it that have i come herebefore the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddhato ask questions on the dharma to behold you to prostrate and to pay you my respects
blessed one this is how i think
i have succeeded in seeing the thusgone one i have succeeded in prostrating to him i have succeeded in paying him my respects i have succeeded in addressing him i have succeeded in addressing him in full
as i now stand before the blessed one he has granted me a free seat indeed my success is of the finest sort
blessed one when the poor man beholds the universal monarch he is filled with wonder and blessed one i too must marvel blessed one this is how i think
the thusgone one is endowed with great love great compassion great joy and great equanimity the qualities that the thusgone one possesses are only his the teachers and no one elses yet the thusgone one does not think himself special supreme or superior what a wonder this is
i think of how the buddha qualities that belong to the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha are not shared by any hearer or solitary buddha
the blessed one then spoke to the venerable mahakasyapa
that is right kasyapa that is right
kasyapa you are right
kasyapa the thusgone ones are boundless and endowed with boundless qualities
it is impossible to measure the extent of their generosity and their transcendent generosity and so on through to their insight and their transcendent insight their aspiration their transcendent aspiration their means their transcendent means their activity their transcendent activity their liberation their transcendent liberation their vision of liberated wisdom and their vision of transcendent liberated wisdomthese are all immeasurable
kasyapa four factors pertain to the thusgone ones unequaled wisdom
due to their possession of those four factors the thusgone ones bring forth the lions roar in the midst of their retinue
which are those four
they are the equality of discipline the equality of absorption the equality of insight and the equality of buddha qualities
kasyapa whoever is endowed with this fourfold wisdom of equality is a thusgone one who proclaims the lions roar in the midst of their retinue
the blessed one then spoke the following verses
buddhas throughout inconceivable worlds endowed with the infinite wisdom of buddhahood have purified the actions of the mind and so proclaim the lions roar
in letting the lions roar resound they terrify the extremists who when hearing of phenomenas intrinsic nature fall into the abyss
those harboring the notion of self and the notion of a sentient being kasyapa such beings i declare to be extremists in terms of this teaching
those keeping the notion of an entity and of my self kasyapa such beings i declare to be extremists in terms of this teaching
those deluded beings who conceitedly consider themselves disciplined concentrated and learned those are extremists kasyapa
i am content and have few desires i remain in solitude and adhere to the simplest of dharma robes those who think this are extremists kasyapa
take the analogy of space when a hand moves through space it is unobstructed moreover as for space it can never be stained by dust
likewise kasyapa those who practice this dharma that i have taught will not be stained by the afflictions it is just as with space and dust or clouds
people may offer flowers and incense or garlands and ointments to the sky yet the sky will not keep track thinking offerings that arise and cease are made to me
space will not be stained its nature will not be stained its nature is devoid of any essence to mendicants so are all empty phenomena
space will not be threatened nor will it ever be abused to mendicants this is how all phenomena are
like space they cannot be tarnished by anything mendicants who train well in this dharma while also showing others the points of training will never develop attachments these i declare to be welltrained mendicants
just as space cannot be blocked by the hand nor sullied by dust or smoke and just as its path cannot be altered so are mendicants who trust the dharma accordingly
across the cloudless sky the moon travels unhindered yet it does so without thinking i shall illumine this space likewise when free from agitation moonlike mendicants visit the households of benefactors their minds should be liberated free from excitement and pride and unstained by any mundane phenomenon
having abandoned pride they thus visit the households and
once there they speak the dharma
having given up desire for pleasures and acquisitions they live in the world by pure discipline
the blessed one then spoke to mahakasyapa
stand up kasyapa
stand up and go take your seat
kasyapa whatever doubts you may have about the dharma you must bring them before the thusgone one
kasyapa i shall answer your questions and delight your mind
the venerable mahakasyapa then rose from where he had been kneeling bowed his head to the feet of the blessed one and took a place at one side
once more the blessed one performed a miraculous act so that all the monks and nuns as well as all the male and female lay practitioners in jambudvipa now came to the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha they approached the site where the blessed one was and as they arrived they bowed their heads to the blessed ones feet and then sat to one side
miraculously the blessed one next caused all the monks nuns male lay practitioners female lay practitioners gods nagas yaksas gandharvas demigods garudas kimnaras and mahoragas to enter the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana and
as they entered this limitless and boundless mass of beings gained insight the blessed one then proceeded to perform more miraculous acts
thereby from the entire trichiliocosm the four great kings king sakra of the gods brahma mahabrahma as well as all the divine sons of the heavens of luminosity unlofty no hardship excellent vision and unexcelled arrived at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha due to the power of the buddha as they arrived they proceeded to the place where the blessed one was residing having bowed their heads to the blessed ones feet they sat to one side
facing the blessed one with their palms joined in homage
the blessed one then performed further miraculous acts thus by the power of the buddha there now appeared the kings of the nagassagara anavatapta kambalesvara gautama nanda upananda manasvin taksaka sundara and elapatraaccompanied by a billion other nagas they all went before the blessed one bowed their heads to his feet in homage and sat to one side
in this way by the power of the buddha such a vast gathering of gods nagas yaksas gandharvas demigods garudas kimnaras mahoragas monks nuns and male and female lay practitioners had now come together at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana everyone entered the grove and took a place there without any anxiety about one another such was the blessed ones miraculous activity
the blessed one now addressed the venerable maudgalyayana
maudgalyayana stand up and prepare a seat for the thusgone one
seated there the thusgone one shall deliver the dharma discourse known as cutting through all doubts
he will display the activity that fulfills the wishes of all sentient beings
he will deliver a teaching of the dharma that satisfies all sentient beings
he will reveal the ocean seal that leads all sentient beings to merge with the dharma
he will explain how to accomplish the activities of all bodhisattva great beings
he will explain the way to cultivate the qualities of the buddhas
he will explain the practices that bring sentient beings to maturity
he will explain how to practice transcendent generosity up until transcendent insight
he will explain the practice of the door to the way of all phenomena
he will show the accomplishment of the lord of all beings
he will show the accomplishment of the activities pertaining to the states of all beings
he will satisfy the four retinues
he will satisfy the retinue of gods nagas yaksas gandharvas demigods garudas kimnaras and mahoragas
he will teach just a fraction of the wisdom that is unhindered and unimpeded with regard to past present and future he will teach just a fraction pertaining to the ripening of karmic action as well as to activity aspiration and wisdom
the venerable maudgalyayana rose from his seat and bowed his head to the feet of the blessed one
he then emanated a seat for the blessed one that was as large as the world of brahma
in the sky above he emanated a courtyard for the blessed one made of the seven precious substances that was as smooth to the touch as kacalindika fabric the courtyard was as vast as a thousandfold universe and it extended for a distance of seven hundred leagues surrounding the courtyard were seven fences seven arches seven ledges and seven layers of lattices made of bells and bangles
to its sides he emanated trees of four precious substances gold silver crystal and beryl
the trees of gold had silver leaves crystal flowers and beryl fruits the trees that were of silver had golden leaves flowers of beryl and fruits of crystal the beryl trees had leaves of gold flowers of silver and fruits of crystal and the crystal trees had leaves of gold silver flowers and beryl fruits
between the trees were ponds filled with water endowed with the eight qualities leading to the water were four steps each of them made of precious substances gold silver beryl and crystal sand of gold was strewn and in the ponds blossomed blue pink red and white lotuses in the sky above he emanated a latticed canopy made of the seven precious substances
the courtyard was decorated with numerous silken tassels the air was filled with pleasant wafts of incense and there were beds of various flowers each the size of seven people
within each of the blue pink red and white lotuses maudgalyayana created a monk who looked just like himself
when the venerable mahamaudgalyayana had magically produced a seat of this sort
he went before the blessed one and said
blessed one i have prepared a seat for you please know that the time is now right
the blessed one then asked
maudgalyayana have you finished arranging my seat
yes blessed one i have replied maudgalyayana
the blessed one then addressed the bodhisattva great being revealing the accomplishment of apprehending infinite objects
noble son prepare a lion throne for the thusgone one
seated upon that throne the thusgone one shall deliver the dharma teaching known as truly satisfying all sentient beings
paying heed to the blessed one the bodhisattva great being revealing the accomplishment of apprehending infinite objects then prepared a seat and
all the bodhisattvas who were in attendance likewise offered their own shawls to the seat spreading them upon the lion throne
next the blessed one formed the following intention
in order to dispel the doubts and hesitations of these bodhisattvas i shall produce a miracle based on their own dharma robes i will grant them a vision of their bodhisattva activities engagements aspirations display of realms and maturation of sentient beings i shall let them perceive the features of the realms within which they are to awaken to true and complete buddhahood likewise i shall let them see their perfect hearers their perfect bodhisattvas and their perfect dharma teaching i shall show them their perfect lifespan perfect complexion perfect form perfect name perfect marks perfect endowments and their perfect dharma fearlessness
then with his wisdom mind thus inclined the blessed one sat down upon his seat and entered the buddhas absorption known as revealing the accomplishment of apprehending infinite objects
as soon as the blessed one had entered this meditative absorption all the bodhisattvas who had placed their upper garments upon the blessed ones seat now came to perceive everythingfrom the perfect array of their own future buddha realm up to their perfect dharma fearlessnesswithin each of their own shawls
witnessing all this the bodhisattvas were deeply gratified and delighted
joyous and elated with one voice they sang the following verses to the blessed one
o you of proper comportment and conduct source of excellent qualities fearless master of all phenomena
endowed with all excellent qualities how beautiful you are
you are a masterful victor who abides in absorption
you are free from falseness and deceit
knowing neither pride agitation nor pretense
you know the deeds related to knowledge and liberation
abiding in this meditative absorption how beautiful you are
with fearless mastery you remain in meditation and so display unparalleled and unsurpassable miracles
revealing your unhindered wisdom with mastery today you have disclosed the future
we now think we have attained the peace of the immutable stage
we now think we have entered awakening
we now think we have conquered the maras
we now think we have gained knowledge
we now think we have attained the supreme eye with which the victorious ones perceive the voidness of all things conditioned
by the kindness of your unhindered wisdom the eye sees utterly unhindered
while perceiving distinctly nothing is seen and no phenomenon is threatening
when the mind is free from hostility then that is the supreme buddha eye
with the victors supreme buddha eye the three realms are known and accessed without any hindrance
with a mind in which entity and nonentity are equal you display true diligence resting within your own vision
when the victorious one entered this absorption he made everyone feel that they had gained accomplishment
all achieved these gateways of retention as well as the supreme gateway of dharma liberation
having entered the gate become skilled and achieved purity the mind of the victorious one shall never decline
such is the ripening of great generosity
such are the qualities of great discipline
such are the qualities of great insight
thus having relied upon these teachings in the past
as you took your seat and practiced concentration
lord of men you shone throughout the ten directions
victor all aspects of death transference and karmic action as they will be for this gathering of your heart children became clearly evident today for all gods nagas nonhumans and kimnaras
within this illuminating absorption arose knowledge across eons thus clearing away doubts and hesitations the best of humans will speak with the voice of a lion
pursuing the welfare of self and others
he has been generous in the past
generous disciplined patient and diligent throughout eons he has practiced for all beings
without any gratitude from sentient beings he is generous disciplined patient and diligent
displaying great skill for the sake of all beings in this way you enter absorption with supreme insight you master such absorption
o hero as today you took your seat we joined our palms and requested you to cut through our doubt and dispel our hesitation
today we have achieved the illumination of all phenomena free from doubt we have achieved illumination for us and for beings to come the way of the dharma will endure for long
this concludes the first chapter
present within the gathering was a youth by the name of padmasrigarbha
he now rose from his seat draped his shawl over one shoulder and knelt on his right knee
joining his palms he bowed toward the blessed one
as he faced the blessed one the following thoughts arose in his mind
i wish to request the gateways of the dharma from the thusgone one
i wish to receive the vajra words i wish to request the words for practice that are without interruption
i wish to request the words that overcome all other statements the words of progressive discernment the words wherein all teachings of the dharma are contained
if the noble sons and daughters practice such a gateway seal
they will attain the stainless eye that sees all phenomena and they will gain expertise regarding the mind
ah blessed one in the past i have borne my armor through the accumulation of intentions and practical deeds thus you will be aware of my roots of virtue from the past arisen through the accumulation of intentions and applications
aware of the youth padmasrigarbhas thoughts and prayers and aware of his practice of accumulating roots of virtue
the blessed one now looked in the four directions and
at the same time four great light rays shone forth from his mouth
as this light emerged from the mouth of the blessed one it spread out into infinite and endless universes and
wherever the light reachedwhether to trees walls mountains earth or the empty atmosphereeverything became suffused with a golden color
in this way the light shone unhindered throughout all the cardinal and intermediate directions
throughout the trichiliocosm wherever sentient beings were touched by this light their bodies became as if made of gold
whoever was suffering from the torments of desire anger or delusion felt that those afflictions decreased
all beings within the trichiliocosm who were living in hell suffering the unbearable ceaseless torments of heat now experienced relief from their pain due to the power of the buddha and the power of the bodhisattvas past prayers
likewise all beings within the trichiliocosm who were affected by the obscurations of karma affliction and the ripening of karma were freed from their obscurations by the power of the buddha and the power of the bodhisattvas past prayers
next to intensely brighten the roots of virtue in sentient beings the blessed one projected great light from all the pores on his body
this great light traveled to the east traversing infinitely many universes
likewise the same occurred in the south west north zenith and nadir the light from the blessed one shone forth and extended across infinitely many universes
the blessed one then produced a special sound that likewise could be heard throughout all those universes
at that point in the east beyond innumerable universes there was a universe known as single parasol within that universe resided the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha single jewel ornament
abiding and remaining present there he taught the dharma
the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha single jewel ornament had prophesied that after himself the bodhisattva great being jaliniprabha would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
now the bodhisattva jaliniprabha approached the blessed thusgone single jewel ornament and asked
blessed one who made this special sound and what is the source of that great light
the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha single jewel ornament replied
noble son to the west of this buddhafield beyond innumerable world realms there is a universe known as enduring
within that universe resides the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha sakyamuni
abiding and remaining present there he is delivering a dharma teaching that belongs to the bodhisattva collection known as truly satisfying all sentient beings
present in the gathering of the blessed thusgone sakyamunis retinue is the bodhisattva great being padmasrigarbha
that bodhisattva wishes to request the gateway for accomplishing all syllablesthe seal whereby one truly engages with all dharmas
jaliniprabha in that buddha realm the retinue contains bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor the armor of undifferentiated activity
jaliniprabha the bodhisattva great beings who have donned such armor also benefit other buddha realms
jaliniprabha anyone born within the buddha realm of the thusgone sakyamuni will upon seeing or hearing those bodhisattva great beings be protected and cared for by them
jaliniprabha needless it is then to mention what will be the case when someone upon seeing these bodhisattva great beings proceeds to pay them respect reveres them venerates them worships them and asks them questions
the bodhisattva great being jaliniprabha then addressed the thusgone single jewel ornament
blessed one i wish to go to that universe so that i may see venerate and serve the blessed thusgone sakyamuni and so that i may see those bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor
said the thusgone single jewel ornament
noble son if you know that the time is right then go but act with mindfulness when you remain in that buddha realm
why do i say so
because noble son the bodhisattva great beings of that realm are hard to approach
the thusgone single jewel ornament then gave an utpala flower that was like a hand to the bodhisattva great being jaliniprabha
jaliniprabha he said you should offer this handlike utpala flower to the thusgone sakyamuni
tell him that the blessed thusgone single jewel ornament inquires whether the blessed one has encountered but little hardship and discomfort and whether he remains healthy strong and at ease
the bodhisattva great being jaliniprabha bowed his head to the feet of the thusgone one the blessed buddha single jewel ornament and then circumambulated him three times
accompanied by bodhisattva great beings beyond number and count he next traveled to the world of enduring arriving there in a single instant of the mind
once here he proceeded to the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha and the place where the blessed one was residing
bowing his head to the blessed ones feet he said
blessed one the bodhisattva jaliniprabha bows his head to your feet in homage
blessed one i am jaliniprabha
blissgone one i am jaliniprabha and
in homage i bow my head to your feet
replied the blessed one
jaliniprabha you shall live long and
you shall be happy and healthy
having in this way bowed to the blessed ones feet the bodhisattva great being jaliniprabha sat to one side and from there addressed the blessed one
blessed one the blessed thusgone single jewel ornament inquires whether the blessed one has encountered but little hardship and discomfort and whether he remains healthy strong and at ease
the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha single jewel ornament also sends a handlike utpala flower for the blessed one
blessed one please therefore accept this handlike utpala flower from the bodhisattva jaliniprabha
the blessed one accepted the flower and then gave it to the bodhisattva ajita
holding the handlike utpala the bodhisattva ajita turned to a group of five hundred that included the bodhisattva bhadrapala
kinsmen said the bodhisattva ajita the thusgone one has given us this handlike utpala
bhadrapala leading the group of five hundred bodhisattvas now held the handlike utpala and addressed the blessed one in the following way
blessed one we have undertaken proper practices and carry out bodhisattva activities therefore is anyone who hears our names certain to awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
blessed one the bodhisattva ajita has given us this handlike utpala
blessed one relying on the power of our aspirations activities intentions and resolve never to abandon sentient beings we shall today toss this handlike utpala in supplication of the thusgone one
blessed one we likewise toss it before all the thusgone ones the worthy ones the perfect buddhas who remain and reside in the east we also toss this flower before the blessed ones who have not yet appeared there before those who are still to appear there before those who are now appearing and before those who are disappearing
we do so likewise in all the universes located in the south west north nadir and zenith as well as in the intermediate directionswe toss this flower before all the blessed buddhas who are present there or who will appear there
blessed one may each and every being who sees this handlike utpala also experience its fragrance
may each and every one of them be certain to awaken to unsurpassable true and perfect buddhahood
may they also journey throughout all buddha realms
then as they tossed the handlike utpala the blessed one touched the flower with his right hand
as soon as he touched it a halfsized body of the thusgone one appeared within the utpala moreover within each of the utpalas there was again a halfsized version of the thusgone one
all these halfsized bodies of the thusgone one now declared the teachers of those who do not know all phenomena to be like an illusion and who are not inclined to think so the teachers of those who do not know all phenomena to be stainless and devoid of characteristics and who are not inclined to think sothe teachers of all those who have no such comprehension are neither thusgone ones nor hearers of the thusgone ones
speaking such words they departed
they also spoke the following verses
illusionlike phenomena cannot be grasped and all that cannot be grasped is like the moon in water
because they are empty they do not possess any empty nature thus this intrinsic nature has been taught by the victorious ones
absence of characteristics is the true characteristic of all phenomena
with such a nature devoid of characteristics upon examination all phenomena are empty and devoid of self they cannot be grasped nor serve as grounds for dispute
whenever beings wish for this intrinsic nature their wish occurs by the blessings of the victorious teachers of great power and their activities throughout the worlds in the ten directions
after the thusgone ones emanations had proclaimed these verses they moved ahead into the ten directions
now the bodhisattva great being jaliniprabha said to the blessed one
blessed one those noble sons are perfectly trained in aspiration any sentient being who hears their prayers or pronounces their names will be entirely freed from the experience of numerous pains and they will become destined for unsurpassable and perfect awakening what a wonder this is
but blessed one such blessed ones and such noble sons are not suited for this universe
why not
blessed one as an analogy a man or woman may have heard of the fame of a priceless and flawless jewel a jewel that can deliver all possible benefit and happiness
that person may then wish to search for the jewel and he or she may also have learned the specific characteristics of that precious jewel
now imagine that this man or woman sees that immaculate jewel in the middle of the dirt in a latrine pit or some other filthy place around that spot there are some bamboo cane workers untouchables outcastes or some other hardlaboring people of low caste
those people have never heard of that jewel so they obviously do not know about its qualities either
it would be out of the question
now the first person who sees the jewel in the filth may remark that the place where that precious jewel is kept is not a very beautiful one
but the others will just respond
which precious jewel do you have such praise for
even though the first person may explain about and even point to the jewel the ignorant people will not understand they will say hey you why are you talking about the qualities of a precious jewel
that precious jewel does not have any good qualities
you are a liar and a trickster
we do not believe anything you say
the first person may then extract the jewel and lift it out from the dirt
as soon as the jewel emerges the poor people will become extremely upset at each other and
from then on they will be surrounded by numerous harms blessed one we are here in the world of enduring a place where poor beings of lesser roots of virtue are born
blessed one the way we perceive you within this world is similar to the way the person of learning in the analogy sees and recognizes the precious jewel in the midst of the filth
blessed one we see the blessed thusgone ones and the bodhisattva great beings who don the inconceivable armor to be like perfect and completely pure jewels capable of granting all manner of happiness
yet blessed one other beings within this world regard them in a way that is similar to the way the poor and lowly people of the area look at the precious jewel
blessed one in the analogy a person heard about the jewels qualities and decided to search for it
when seeing the jewel in a pit of filth he or she remarked that the jewel was not kept in a proper place similarly
blessed one the blessed buddhas and the bodhisattvas present throughout the ten directions also remark that the blessed ones buddha realm is not befitting to him in this way they praise the blessed buddha and all the bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor
in the analogy blessed one a man or woman heard about the qualities of a precious jewel decided to go searching for it found the jewel stuck in filth and subsequently declared that the jewel was not being kept properly we similarly have heard praises of the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha as well as of the bodhisattva great beings who have donned the inconceivable armor
hence we journeyed here to behold them
but being here blessed one
we see that this universe is plagued by hundreds of shortcomings and that sentient beings here possess inferior roots of virtue
blessed one the precious jewel in the mud does not lose its brilliance and just as in that analogy the thusgone ones in the ten directions and the bodhisattva great beings who don the inconceivable armor do not lose their radiance either
however because the intentions and aspirations of beings here are of an inferior quality the blessed one has caused his luster to extend for a distance of no more than one fathom
in the analogy blessed one the poor people do not believe what they hear about the qualities of the jewel likewise
beings in this universe do not believe in the thusgone ones extreme brilliance his vast aspirations his emanations and his qualities of awakening
needless it is then to state that they do not have faith in the bodhisattva great beings either
blessed one when the person in the analogy takes out the precious jewel from the dirt that immediately causes the others there to experience great harm similarly
when the thusgone one passes completely beyond suffering and the bodhisattva great beings depart for other world realms it causes bodhisattvas who retain sutras and who pursue true retention to become extremely disturbed with one another the dharma is no longer heard only nondharma can be heard here
and why is that
because under such circumstances those who live here would fall into nondharma and pursue nondharmic means of livelihood
they would struggle with defame criticize and disparage one another
they would cause each other to lose their virtuous qualities and thus experience suffering they would no longer apply themselves to dharma and virtue
blessed one no noble son or daughter in pursuit of the meaningful committed to the pursuit of meaning and committed to the accomplishment of a buddhas awakening would in that case take birth in this world as not even followers of the hearer vehicle would appear what need is there to mention those who adhere to the bodhisattva vehicle
why do i say so blessed one well the beings who live in the great hell realms such as incessant pain revival heat and intense heat do not experience happiness for even one moment for even a mere instant
blessed one from the perspective of the bodhisattvas in single parasol the realm of the blessed thusgone one single jewel ornamentthe bodhisattva great beings who are born in this enduring world are comparable to the beings born in the hell of incessant pain because they do not perceive them to experience any happiness at all
in a buddha realm of sheer and supreme happiness sentient beings are naturally blissful
but blessed one the beings who are born in this universe find it hard to believe what i say nevertheless blessed one i have come here to clear my doubts about the dharma and to listen to the gateway of the dharma seal blessed one we seek teaching from you
and why
because blessed one all pleasure and pain is impermanent
from the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha we wish to hear a dharma in which there is no happiness no suffering no permanence no impermanence no thought no conception no entity no absence of entity nothing conditioned nothing unconditioned nothing imputed nothing not imputed nothing mundane nothing beyond the world nothing defiled nothing undefiled no truth no falsity no awakening no branches of awakening no powers no light no darkness no consciousness no absence of consciousness no fruition no lack of fruition no path no absence of path no beginning no completion no world and no liberation from the world
and why is that so
because blessed one the world should be taught about the happiness that arises from the accumulation of merit and from making resolutions and all other such things
blessed one the qualities of buddhahood cannot be taught
that is to say in buddhahood there are no powers no fearlessnesses no miracles no miraculous displays no advice no miraculous advice no teaching and no miraculous teaching
there are no fearlessnesses nor powers and
there is neither happiness nor suffering
because all that is thought all that is conceptual movement
blessed one whether someone qualifies for the title of thusgone one is not to be decided in terms of whether or not suchness has been attained
all that is conceptual movement thought straying and construction
truth and falsity the conditioned and the unconditioned the defiled and the undefiled negativity and lack of negativity the mundane and the supramundane being disciplined and having flawed discipline having powers and not having powers being fearless and not being fearless being worthy of donations and not being worthy of donations being a thusgone one being a buddha being a bodhisattva being a hearer being a solitary buddha as well as prayers and blessingsall such thinking is completely crushed by the thusgone ones and the path is comprehended completely
that is why the thusgone ones are undaunted like lions that is why they trumpet like elephants
when they make their assertions the thusgone ones let there be disagreement where there is disagreement and agreement where there is agreement
the thusgone ones make their assertions with mindfulness and wisdom and with both dwell in equanimity
the states of the blessed thusgone ones are states of awakening and states that are selfarisen since they are not even shared by hearers or solitary buddhas they are of course not common to other lowly beings
and why blessed one are they not shared with others
because all other lowly beings cannot achieve states that are of that quality or that are so comprehensive or that are of the same duration or with the same application or that involve such bliss blessed one without the thusgone ones no sentient being can achieve such states
blessed one such states are not accessible to any other being blessed one states of this kind are not accessible to any hearer or solitary buddha
blessed one not accessible here means that they are not effectuated or experienced
hence they are inaccessible
and why is this so
because such states surpass the experience of hearers and solitary buddhas
and why is that the case
because blessed one such states are infinite
and why blessed one are such states infinite
because blessed one the wishes of the thusgone ones are infinite
they cannot be matched by anything at all
and why is this so
because blessed one such states are beyond language
being beyond language is to be inexpressible and
language is nothing but expression therefore blessed one these states are selfarisen
blessed one beings who do not observe such states and do not understand them must go through death and transfer to other world realms
beings who do not comprehend such states come to suffer great harm
blessed one the state of the thusgone ones is the ultimate gateway the gateway of the dharma
it contains sixtyeight thousand subsidiary gateways
the awakening of the thusgone single jewel ornament is limitless like space and the bodhisattva great beings gain accomplishment through the extent of the very same gateway
when this gateway teaching was delivered and explained seventyseven thousand bodhisattva great beings attained the gateway of the stainless dharma which is the very state of the thusgone ones
they all thus declared today we have attained awakening today we have attained awakening
furthermore one quadrillion beings set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening and
because of their initial generation of the mind of awakening the blessed one prophesied their attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening
likewise eight sextillion beings attained the stainless and immaculate dharma eye that sees phenomena and
three thousand monks liberated their minds from defilement with no further perpetuation
at this point the blessed one smiled and
as soon as he did so a magnificent light shone forth in the world and the great earth shook
the venerable ananda now draped his dharma robe over one shoulder and knelt on his right knee
joining his palms he bowed toward the blessed one and inquired
when the blessed one smiled a magnificent light shone in the world and the great earth shook what were the causes and conditions for this to happen
the blessed one replied
ananda when the bodhisattva jaliniprabha taught and explained this gateway of the dharma
seventyseven thousand bodhisattvas attained the gateway of the stainless dharma seal
ananda the bodhisattva jaliniprabha has obtained this teaching of the dharma seal from eight thousand buddhas at locations throughout the expanse of space
having thus obtained this stainless dharma gateway he has gained deliverance by means of it and so he has become skilled in journeying from buddha realm to buddha realm
at that time beyond seventyeight innumerable buddha realms to the west there was a world known as single heap of jewels within that universe resided a thusgone one a worthy one a perfect buddha known as infinite jewel leader
abiding and remaining present there he taught the dharma to a retinue of many hundreds of thousands
present in that gathering was also the regent of the blessed one infinite jewel leader the bodhisattva great being purposeful compelling leader
hearing a clear voice and perceiving the light from the thusgone sakyamuni the bodhisattva great being purposeful compelling leader asked the thusgone infinite jewel leader
blessed one whose is this clear voice and whose is this radiance
then the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha infinite jewel leader said to the bodhisattva great being purposeful compelling leader
purposeful compelling leader to the west beyond seventyeight innumerable universes there is a world known as enduring
within that universe resides a thusgone one a worthy one a perfect buddha known as sakyamuni
abiding and remaining present there he is now teaching a gathering headed by incomparable bodhisattvas
he is delivering a dharma teaching belonging to the bodhisattva collection that satisfies all beings and is known as cutting through the doubts of all beings
at this point the bodhisattva great being purposeful compelling leader said to the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha infinite jewel leader
blessed one i wish to go to the world known as enduring so that i may see venerate and serve the blessed thusgone sakyamuni and so that i may see those incomparable bodhisattvas
replied the blessed thusgone infinite jewel leader
noble son if you know that the time has come then go but act with mindfulness as you remain in that buddha realm
why do i say that
because purposeful compelling leader the bodhisattva great beings born in that world are hard to approach
when you arrive ask on my behalf whether the blessed one has encountered but little hardship and discomfort and whether he remains healthy strong and at ease
you must also offer this handlike lotus flower to the thusgone one
the bodhisattva great being purposeful compelling leader then rose from his seat and bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one
after he had also circumambulated that blessed one he left for the world of enduring accompanied by seventyeight thousand other bodhisattvas
as soon as they arrived all the flowering trees and fruit trees in enduring bore flowers and fruits regardless of the season
a rain of flowers and scented water fell from the sky and
numerous musical sounds could be heard
the bodhisattva great being purposeful compelling leader proceeded to the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha
arriving there he bowed his head to the feet of the blessed one
holding on to the blessed ones feet with both hands and
touching them to his head he said
blessed one the bodhisattva purposeful compelling leader bows his head to your feet in homage
replied the blessed one
purposeful compelling leader you have offered your respect worship and veneration
then the bodhisattva great being purposeful compelling leader stood up and
standing before the blessed one he said
the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha infinite jewel leader inquires whether the blessed one may have encountered but little hardship and discomfort and whether he remains healthy strong and at ease
blessed one he also sends you a handlike lotus flower requesting that out of your great love you accept it from the bodhisattva purposeful compelling leader
having in this way received the handlike lotus flower from the bodhisattva the blessed one inquired
purposeful compelling leader has the blessed thusgone infinite jewel leader encountered but little hardship and discomfort and does he remain unchanged
replied purposeful compelling leader
blessed one the blessed thusgone infinite jewel leader has encountered but little hardship he is strong and remains unchanged happily enjoying his buddha realm
then the blessed one gave the handlike lotus flower to the bodhisattva great being ajita
holding up the lotus the bodhisattva great being ajita offered the following prayer
blessed one by this root of virtue may the buddha realms of all noble sons and daughters who set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening be perfectly pure and
may sentient beings gain maturity
why do i express this prayer
because blessed one it is hard to teach the dharma to beings who are not mature who have not engendered roots of virtue who possess lesser roots of virtue or who are inspired by what is inferior
and what is here the objective
the objective is blessed one for this handlike lotus flower to enable beings to perceive whichever realm of the world they may wish the objective is for the flower to enable the perception of the world known as heap of jewels the buddha realm of the blessed thusgone infinite jewel leader it is to enable the perception of the bodhisattvas of that world who have truly entered their vehicle as well as the perception of the perfect hearers there who for the most part are endowed with the threefold or sixfold knowledge
in that blessed thusgone ones buddha realm the lotus flowers are produced through a great ripening of karma
hence blessed one i dedicate this root of virtue so that bodhisattvas may be free from obscuration with regard to any phenomenon
blessed one i dedicate this root of virtue so that those bodhisattvas who have not yet engendered the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakening may do so
i dedicate this root of virtue toward the thusgone ones perfect awakening to the suchness of all phenomena and their perfect awakening to the suchness that is free from disturbance
then the blessed one asked bhadrapala
bhadrapala do you understand what maitreya has said
what are the phenomena to which the thusgone ones perfectly awaken
replied bhadrapala
blessed one there are no phenomena that pertain to the thusgone ones perfect awakening to suchness and their perfect awakening to freedom from disturbance
blessed one the thusgone ones do not apprehend any such phenomena since there are no such phenomena nor is there an absence of such phenomena
blessed one if such a phenomenon was apprehended it would only be the apprehending of the perception of the phenomenon by the thusgone ones but the thusgone ones do not apprehend any such perception
why is that
because blessed one there are no perceptions at all
since the thusgone ones do not even apprehend themselves it goes without saying that they do not apprehend any perception
let alone having any authentic engagement in the perception of phenomena as phenomena
blessed one the blessed one has not said that any phenomena at all are grasped nor that they are relinquished nor that they are transcended nor that they are attained by those phenomena being perceived as they are and because they are so
what then does this mean
blessed one if the thusgone ones were to seek phenomena where would they seek them
those phenomena are suchness and within suchness there is no thusgone one
moreover the thusgone ones are suchness they are thusgone ones by virtue of suchness
for the thusgone ones there are no marks they are thusgone ones by virtue of the absence of marks
the thusgone ones are free of marks they are thusgone ones by virtue of freedom from marks
the thusgone ones know minds they are thusgone ones by virtue of knowing minds
the thusgone ones are free from disturbance they are thusgone ones by virtue of freedom from disturbance
moreover all phenomena are just like the thusgone ones they are thusgone ones by virtue of being just like them
in this way blessed one all phenomena are thusgone ones
that is why blessed one the thusgone ones remain within the lotuses and just as they remain within the lotuses so likewise they remain in the state of a thusgone and in the state of awakening
those who neither grasp nor apprehend that in which they remain in that way are to be classified as worthy recipients of offerings in this world
asked the blessed one
bhadrapala where do you remain as you speak these words
replied bhadrapala
blessed one i remain exactly where the world remains and i speak these words from there
however this is not the way childish beings grasp it
how then do childish beings grasp
they grasp disturbance and because they grasp disturbance they are disturbed and very disturbed
blessed one the world does not remain
in what sense does it not remain
in the sense that an illusion does not remain
yet childish beings argue saying my place that is the world
however this is not the realm of childish beings
the world does not remain within that which is an optical illusion nor does it remain within that which is impermanent
yet this frightens childish beings
the world does not remain within that which is a hallucination and
this is not any different from noble beings
the world does not remain within the repulsive yet
childish beings are motivated by karma
here blessed one where the world remains there is no occasion for any of the disturbance of the world
hence blessed one the place where i remain is here alone where the world remains
the blessed one now asked the bodhisattva bhadrapala
bhadrapala do you say this through truly seeing phenomena
replied bhadrapala
blessed one whatever is a phenomenon is only not what the blessed one has perfectly awoken to
the blessed one then inquired of the bodhisattva great being bhadrapala
bhadrapala have i not perfectly awoken to all phenomena
answered bhadrapala
blessed one have you perfectly awoken to all phenomena
blessed one that to which which you have perfectly awoken is that phenomena or is it not phenomena
replied the blessed one
well said bhadrapala well said
that which the thusgone ones fully awake to is neither phenomena nor is it an absence of phenomena
bhadrapala my wisdom does not move somewhere and my eyes do not engage something
there is no cognition of beings nor any engagement of the mind
no appearance is cognized yet neither is any exclusion cognized or apprehended
that is because this is neither affliction nor purification
however bhadrapala even if i explain to sentient beings about the notion of the experience of no characteristics and the phenomena of the experience of no characteristics they become bewildered
bhadrapala apart from thusgone ones and bodhisattva great beings in their final existence you will not be able to find or observe anyone who can accept this
bhadrapala even when bodhisattva great beings who are in their final existence held back by just that single birth hear this dharma it still frightens them
so what need is there to mention the case of lowly sentient beings
it is impossible for them to comprehend this dharma
bhadrapala there will come a time when all monks and nuns and all male and female lay practitioners are physically and mentally untrained and lack training in discipline and insight
bhadrapala when such persons hear the teaching of the dharma treasure and the treasure of the thusgone one in which the awakening of the thusgone ones being beyond thought affliction and perception is not accessed
they will be frightened scared and afraid and thus they will fall into the abyss
the reason for this is that while it is taught that the thusgone ones have perfectly awakened to all phenomena there is also the teaching that my wisdom eyes and mind do not have any access to it
therefore such monks who teach the sutras will develop the wish to harm hurt kill and cause unrest
bhadrapala at that time those who rise up against me in this way will be in control
how unfortunate that time will be when those who teach my true wisdom will be castigated
bhadrapala the thusgone one has no teacher and is selfarisen such fools do not understand the thusgone one as he now lets his lions roar be heard within the circle of disciples and they do not understand the intrinsic nature of the thusgone one
consider how lacking knowledge and vision they will fail to recognize that which is a praise to me and instead take something that actually is no praise to be just that
bhadrapala you may wonder what that which is no praise entails
bhadrapala any teaching concerned with grasping at something is no praise to me
that is why i say that at that time those people will defame me rise against me and undermine virtuous mendicants mendicants of that kind are corrupted and putrid like rotting trees their way of looking at things is that of an extremist a dualist an adherent to permanence and annihilation theirs is the way of the arrogant dharma teachers who suffer from dharma conceit of those involved in mental construction of those involved in the formation of notions of those fond of materialism of those partaking in samsara and of those who turn their backs on the path of the true view
at that time such persons will develop the notion of the ultimate adhere to the sacrificial fire ritual becoming unbraided profess to objects and profess to agents
however bhadrapala if they possess the proper absorption they will also realize awakening
bhadrapala when i have passed into nirvana such people will perceive flaws in terms of object and agent and thus regress
when they then go forth in my teachings they will make that dharma fade away
thus bhadrapala after i have passed into nirvana
such fools will perform the sacrificial fire ritual they will become like the braided like those who are old and the dull witted
bhadrapala such people are involved with reference points constructs and karmic formation by means of a mundane view they engage with my objects and agents and teach but little in terms of the wisdom of the buddhas
i say that what such people teach is no praise to me and is not emancipation
and why not
because bhadrapala such people make use of an impure and insignificant fire that discards the awakening accomplished through millions of incalculable eons
bhadrapala such people defame the thusgone one and rise up against him
bhadrapala you may then wonder what it is to praise the thusgone one and proclaim his words
bhadrapala those who do so do not grasp construct or develop karmic formations with respect to any phenomenon they do not pursue the three times but are beyond statements and beyond abandonment
such people bhadrapala utter praise to the thusgone one and they do not impute those are the offspring of the buddhas the children of their minds they are born from the dharma
bhadrapala teachers and upholders of such sutras proclaim the words of the thusgone one they proclaim the dharma and have entered the thusgone ones teaching in accord with the dharma those are my children the children of my heart the children of my voice they are blessed by me and appointed by me i have brought them true delight and they have established the shrine of the dharma
they have beaten the drum of the dharma and blown the dharma conch
they have raised high the dharmas victory banner
inspired by the blessed buddhas such beings have accumulated proper activities
they adhere to the garland of the excellent qualities and are appointed as their guardians
they defeat adversaries and are like flowers in the world
encountering such beings is extremely rare their vision is pure and
they are vessels of awakening the bodhisattvas bring them joy
the thusgone ones bring them joy
they have opened their vision of the dharma and are not obscured with respect to any phenomenon
they rightly please the thusgone ones and repay their kindness
adorned with the ornaments of the dharma they are saturated with wisdom
letting the rain of dharma fall they satisfy the heart children of the victorious ones
causing the qualities of buddhahood to increase they display the foliage of excellent qualities
blossoming with the flowers of the branches of awakening they produce the fruits of freedom from desirous attachment
residing on the seat of awakening they attain unexcelled and perfect awakening
they are the guides who show the path
they are immersed in dharma generosity
in short bhadrapala even if all the thusgone ones explain the qualities of such noble children people will find it hard to trust
bhadrapala such beings are the ones who proclaim my praises those are teachers who speak in accord with the dharma
bhadrapala this is how it is think of a man who has seen lake anavatapta and heard its praises
that man may then see another great lake and say
the dimensions of that lake are exactly like those of anavatapta i shall sing the praises of anavatapta
yet what he then proclaims is not going to be a praise bhadrapala the people of the aforementioned kind are similar fools while deprived of the right kind of qualities and the right kind of wisdom they nevertheless say we shall sing the praises of the thusgone one
thus while abiding by the mundane view engaging in formation and engaging all the aggregates of defilement they maintain this conduct yet declare the wisdom of the thusgone ones is unimpeded let us offer our praise
yet what they proceed to say is certainly no praise
think bhadrapala of this analogy a person may know the word gold and may also have heard descriptions of the yellow radiant color of gold
but even if that person sees the golden color of the jambu river and hears about its precious value
he might ignore it he might also scold the people who informed him saying that which you are talking about does not have the yellow color of gold
likewise bhadrapala the aforementioned blind fools may have heard the name of the thusgone one and they may also have heard the word dharma they may have heard that the name for the dharma is the true view and they may have heard it said that the thusgone ones name family dominion retinue comportment and conduct are all perfect
but they have not heard of the characteristic of the thusgone ones wisdomthe characteristic that makes him a thusgone one a blessed one a perfect buddha neither have they heard of the characteristic of the dharmathe characteristic through which the thusgone one delivers all teachings the characteristic of the thusgone ones wisdom
moreover when at some point they do in fact hear about the characteristic of the thusgone ones wisdom such fools proceed to reject it
bhadrapala somebody may have heard the word ocean yet not be aware of the oceans qualities
the same person may then be told that the ocean is eightyfour thousand leagues deep and limitless leagues wide he or she may likewise hear that the ocean abounds with numerous jewels that it is of a single taste and that it neither increases nor becomes depleted when hearing such descriptions of how the ocean does not fill up although fed by the rivers how they are the source of so many jewels and how its extent is limitless this person may object that the ocean could not possibly have such characteristics likewise
bhadrapala those fools have heard the name thusgone one and the word buddha but they have not heard about the qualities of the thusgone ones or the qualities of knowing the dharma
however at some point they may come to hear dharma teachings concerning the omniscient wisdom full of limitless jewels of the dharma they may hear of how the precious dharma is free from desire and how it provides boundless means for achieving great liberation they may hear of the unobscured buddha eye how the undefiled qualities know neither increase nor decrease and how they are hard to fathom and free from disturbance they may come to hear that all phenomena bear the seal of wisdom likewise they may be told that just like the ocean will not retain a human corpse the thusgone ones will not rest with beings who are spoiled by dense dark views similarly they may hear the teaching that just like the ocean is always salty the liberation of the thusgone ones is also always of one taste
yet they do not understand this and they do not believe it
not trusting it they deny that any of this could be the case
consider bhadrapala how fools never question their own knowledge or the extent of their training
however i declare that there will come a time when they say we do not know the proper conduct and practice we do not understand karmic action and the way karma ripens we do not know what actions led us to birth here and where our present actions will bring us we do not know what the realm will be nor what our features and practice are going to be neither do we know whether or not we will be able to act based on insight
such unquestioning fools may develop the idea that these dharma teachings are neither dharma nor any praise to me
in that case my words will have become the reason for such fools not to rely on the sutras
when after my passing someone expresses a praise to the thusgone one or to the dharma or to the sangha then
you must not be disrespectful or distrustful
you must not let your mind turn away and you must not be displeased this is how the thusgone one instructs you
my instruction here is that a hostile mind is not the way of mendicants it is common to those who are not mendicants moreover
not being a mendicant and following the ways of those who are not mendicants is flawed in numerous ways
the awakening of the thusgone ones is hard to fathom
hence my instruction is that only the applications of mindfulness should be taught
bhadrapala the way all phenomena essentially abide is beyond abiding and
this way of abiding is nonconceptual
bhadrapala in this context the three gateways to access realization and liberation are the gateways to the applications of mindfulness
bhadrapala tenable and untenable are duality
bhadrapala in the true view and the relinquishment of extremes that comes from not observing any extremes there is no attachment to duality
bhadrapala the thusgone ones relinquishment of extremes is not due to a failure to identify such extremes
rather the thusgone ones have abandoned extremes because they do not observe any
bhadrapala the wise do not understand the qualities of the thusgone ones relinquishment in the same way that childish beings take them to be
those qualities bhadrapala are characterized neither by relinquishment nor transcendence
their characteristics are neither in terms of abandonment nor attainment
bhadrapala once a deity came before me and asked
mendicant are you in high spirits
i replied
deity what should i have gained
again the god asked mendicant are you depressed
i replied
deity what should i have wasted
at this point the god exclaimed
a mendicant who is neither in high spirits nor depressed is indeed an excellent mendicant
bhadrapala that god is now present in this gathering
he has bhadrapala comprehended how all phenomena are of the nature of nirvana
in the past he has served five hundred buddhas and
as the result of such service his superknowledges are agile
bhadrapala i do not say that beings who lack roots of virtue or whose roots of virtue have not matured will be inspired to pursue the training in this dharma teaching
nor do i perceive any such inspiration in the listeners either
bhadrapala when someone hears these teachings and becomes inspired and develops faith and trust the associated roots of virtue are of a lesser inner kind
above that stage as the wisdom of great insight unfolds one will experience wisdom the roots of virtue that arise from that are vast
bhadrapala and the others among the five hundred bodhisattvas then tossed the handlike lotus flower before the blessed one offering it with the following words
blessed one may all who witness this dharma teaching of the handlike lotus flower and pursue or apply themselves to it become destined for unexcelled and perfect awakening
blessed one may all the blessed buddhas who reside remain and flourish throughout the ten directionsall such thusgone ones worthy ones perfect buddhasapprehend this dharma teaching and teach it for the sake of ripening the factors of awakening within sentient beings
aware of all this the blessed one now said to the bodhisattva great being bhadrapala
bhadrapala you bear your armor for the sake of ripening the factors of awakening within sentient beings and you request the thusgone ones the worthy ones the perfect buddhas to teach the dharma to these sentient beings does this mean that sentient beings are of some benefit to you
in reply the bodhisattva great being bhadrapala addressed the blessed one
blessed one i have no wish to send those who benefit me to buddha realms nor do i feel disinclined to do so with those who harm me i do not bear my armor for sentient beings in order to harm or benefit anyone
blessed one the armor donned by bodhisattvas is not of that kind
blessed one let us take the analogy of a perfect wishfulfilling tree with blossoming flowers on all its branches a tree that is of great delight to the gods in the heaven of the thirtythree as they perceive this heavenly wishfulfilling tree in full bloom
the gods of the thirtythree will to their hearts content enjoy and revel in superhuman sense pleasures
but blessed one do the gods of the thirtythree then harm or benefit that perfect wishfulfilling tree that is in full bloom
as they see the perfect wishfulfilling tree the gods of the thirtythree will be delighted
to their hearts content they will enjoy and revel in superhuman sense pleasures and touching that heavenly wishfulfilling tree in full bloom they will be overjoyed
yet the gods of the thirtythree certainly neither benefit nor harm that perfect wishfulfilling tree in any way at all
but to partake of their enjoyments the gods of the thirtythree are required to be near that perfect wishfulfilling tree whose branches are all in full bloom similarly
blessed one by no means do sentient beings either harm or benefit me
however in terms of the accomplishment of wisdom the wisdom of the buddhas
it is as in the analogy of that perfect wishfulfilling tree in full bloom all these infinitely and innumerably many sentient beings must by all means be present hence i don my armor for the sake of sentient beings
moreover by means of the five masteries of the thusgone ones who themselves are not subject to being pleased sentient beings will experience joy just like the gods of the thirtythree they will be happy frolic and revel to their hearts content
blessed one we bear our armor in order to disengage from sentient beingsnot for the sake of observing them
we bear it for the sake of disengaging from the selfnot for the sake of observing it
we bear it for the sake of disengaging from phenomenanot for the sake of observing them
we bear it for the sake of disengaging from the aggregatesnot for the sake of observing them
we bear it for the sake of disengaging from the elementsnot for the sake of observing them
we bear it for the sake of disengaging from the sense sourcesnot for the sake of observing them
such is the armor of disengagement that we bear
blessed one this is an armor of disengagement
it is not an armor and does not bring the results of an armor
hence it is not worn for the sake of obtaining anything at all neither is it worn for the sake of giving up anything we do not think of it as an armor or assert it to be so
we do not assert it to be in any particular way as having any particular extent or as having any particular purpose such is the armor that we bear
blessed one if we were to assert the armor in any way we would also perpetuate the self but
blessed one we do not perpetuate the self
we do not perpetuate it bodhisattvas do not apprehend there being or not being a self
blessed one if there is abiding on there not being a self that implies nothing but abiding on the existence of a self
this is because blessed one all phenomena are beyond abiding
blessed one this is how we train with our armor in the world
that is to say this is not a training in anything at all
the bodhisattva great being bhadrapala then spoke as follows to the blessed one
blessed one i do not perceive the qualities of ordinary persons to be far away nor do i perceive the qualities of the buddhas to be nearby
i do not perceive the qualities of training to be distant
nor do i perceive the qualities of the buddhas to be close
i do not perceive such a thing as the qualities of buddhahood
nor do i perceive in terms of anything being in accord with the qualities of buddhahood
blessed one i neither perceive any benefits nor do i perceive any flaws such is the armor that i have donned
such is the armor that i bear in the world
bhadrapala and the others among the five hundred bodhisattvas who had tossed the lotus flower before the blessed one then journeyed out into the worlds of the ten directions
they let a rain fall on the blessed buddhas and they brought sentient beings to maturation
at that time there was in the east beyond countless and innumerable universes a universe known as marks of royal splendor and within that universe resided a thusgone one a worthy one a perfect buddha called roar of signlessness
abiding and remaining present there he taught the dharma
this blessed one had prophesied that following himself the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
now having seen the great light and heard the special sound the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin addressed the blessed thusgone roar of signlessness
blessed one from whence comes this special sound and what is the source of this great illumination
replied the blessed one to the bodhisattva great being
sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin west of this buddha realm beyond countless and innumerable world realms there is a universe known as enduring
within that universe resides the thusgone one sakyamuni
abiding and remaining present there he is delivering a dharma teaching that belongs to the bodhisattva collection and is known as truly satisfying all sentient beings by eliminating their doubts
that is the source of the light and the distinctive sound
in that buddha realm have arrived within the circle of the retinue infinite and unfathomable bodhisattva great beings who bear the inconceivable armor
in response the bodhisattva said to that blessed one
blessed one i wish to visit that universe so that i may see venerate and serve the blessed thusgone sakyamuni
i also wish to see those bodhisattvas
and why
because it is hard to even hear about such beings needless it is then to mention how difficult it is to behold and venerate them
the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha roar of signlessness then said to the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin
noble son if you know that the time has come then go
the thusgone one grants you permission the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin then rose from his seat
he bowed his head to the feet of that blessed one and circumambulated him
upon his departure the blessed one then placed a lotus flower in the bodhisattvas hand and told him sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin you must offer this lotus flower to the blessed thusgone sakyamuni on my behalf
thus the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin came to the world of enduring with that lotus flower in his hand
then from that great lotus flower appeared all the superior beings who had been part of the retinue of the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha roar of signlessness when he engaged in bodhisattva activity
moreover so that this could be experienced by the sentient beings there similar such great lotus flowers now spread throughout the universe
holding the lotus flower the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin thus came to the universe known as enduring
at the very moment he arrived there all the trees fruits flowers and leaves that existed in enduringdown to the size of just four finger widthsappeared from sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartins hand
moreover in each of their own languages all beings in enduring began to speak of impermanence suffering and the absence of self
they also spoke of the masteries the powers the branches of awakening the concentrations the liberations the absorptions and the attainments
witnessing all this the venerable saradvatiputra exclaimed
ah how wondrous that the thusgone one the foedestroyer the perfect buddha performs such miracles
said the blessed one
saradvatiputra these miracles are not of the thusgone one
saradvatiputra these are the miracles of the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin
saradvatiputra to the east of this buddha realm beyond innumerable and countless universes there is a universe known as marks of royal splendor
within that universe resides the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha roar of signlessness
from the realm where that buddha abides and remains present the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin has arrived
all this appears due to the ripening of that bodhisattvas past actions
asked saradvatiputra
blessed one which numerous roots of virtue did the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin gather so that he now through their ripening has achieved such mastery
replied the blessed one
saradvatiputra it is excellent that you thought to ask the thusgone one about this matter
saradvatiputra such eloquence is exclusively due to the power of the thusgone one
listen saradvatiputra i shall explain this to you
when all the blessed buddhas in the past awoke to perfect buddhahood and resided upon the seat of awakening the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin was the one who initially supplicated them and requested them to teach
this is how he accumulated the virtuous roots for unsurpassable and perfect awakening
as he went before them he would sometimes become brahma and so make requests and supplicate
other times he would do so in the form of sakra universal emperors kings or sages
for example saradvatiputra when i had first awoken to true and perfect buddhahood
mahabrahma invoked and supplicated me saying there are beings whose karmic obscurations are minor who suffer from not having heard the dharma and who act in accord with the teachings of the thusgone ones blessed one please therefore teach the dharma blissgone one please turn the wheel of dharma
saradvatiputra the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin has invoked and supplicated all the past buddhas in the same way requesting them please teach the dharma please turn the wheel of dharma
all the roots of virtue that he gathered he has dedicated exclusively to the supplication for the turning of the wheel of dharma
saradvatiputra let me provide you with an illustration that establishes this point fully
within this trichiliocosm a billion suns and moons are in movement four billion oceans surround the continents of which there are likewise four billion there are seven billion islands a billion tall surrounding mountains and a billion inner circles of mountains
saradvatiputra now imagine that this trichiliocosm becomes like the ocean eightyfour thousand leagues deep and wide
imagine then saradvatiputra that the thousandfold universe is filled up with sesame seeds and that some strong powerful and diligent person comes by
this person takes up the sesame seeds by the handful and tosses them in the four directions
as the seeds are carried by the wind
each one of them produces an entire universe
saradvatiputra what do you think
as they thus appear from each sesame seed how many universes are there
replied saradvatiputra
blessed one there are innumerable universes
blissful one there are universes beyond count
said the blessed one
saradvatiputra try to imagine and understand this
let us say that all these universes that arose from the sesame seeds were to turn into a single city
imagine that the city reaches as high as it is wide and that
it is surrounded by a solid stable unbreakable and indestructible wall
saradvatiputra now imagine if that great city became a granary full of grains
saradvatiputra what do you think
how large would the heap of grains then be
replied saradvatiputra
blessed one it would be immeasurable
blissful one it could not be fathomed
said the blessed one
saradvatiputra try to imagine and understand this
it is in fact possible that some mathematicians or master mathematicians could calculate the extent of such a mass of grains
yet the amount of thusgone ones residing on the seats of awakening to whom the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin has paid worship invoked and supplicated to turn the wheel of dharma when they first attained perfect buddhahood is indeed beyond count
and there are even many more blessed buddhas for whom he has prepared and offered a dharma wheel made of the seven precious substances
and again compared to that amount there are far more blessed buddhas to whom he has offered a flower wheel or a wheel of incense without having dedicated it to unsurpassable and perfect awakening
why then even mention the exquisitely adorned wheels of gold silver and wood that he has offered to the blessed buddhas
all such offerings to the blessed buddhas he has dedicated toward the turning of the dharma wheel and thus he has supplicated again and again
there was a time when the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha royal leader treading with great strength appeared in the world
at that time there was a king by the name of blazing with famed power
who reigned as a universal emperor within the trichiliocosm
there within the retinue of his queens or residing in his parks the king would pursue the pleasures of the senses frolicking and reveling
yet one time as he asked his queens to entertain him with song dance and music he instead heard the words of impermanence suffering and the absence of self
immediately the king became disenchanted with his pleasures
having lost his desire he became frightened and sad and in such a frame of mind he went before the thusgone royal leader treading with great strength
having bowed his head to the thusgone ones feet he took a place before him upon the kings arrival the blessed one spoke on roots of virtue from the past and
as the king listened he thought
the blessed one sees with wisdom free of any obscuration and
he has realized roots of virtue for so long
as for myself compared to him i am not aware of any virtuous roots
before so many buddhas i have created roots of virtue yet they were all polluted by the muck of sense pleasures politics and power thus i did not recognize them and
i did not dedicate them to awakening may all the roots of virtue that i now form be dedicated to the welfare of all beings
throughout all places realms and buddha realms may words be spoken in the languages that beings understand and
may all beings thus come to hear of impermanence suffering and the absence of self
in all worlds may all plants and trees even the smallest ones resound with the words of impermanence suffering and the absence of self and
may all beings hear those words
may all accumulated roots of virtue cause all beings to equally enter the great vehicle with a wisdom that is just like that of the thusgone royal leader treading with great strength with this understanding king blazing with famed power then rose from his seat
standing before the blessed one he said
blessed one all of my possessions throughout my entire realm i offer without exception to the buddhas and so forth so that the noble sangha may partake of them
having made this offering king blazing with famed power then went forth from his household and became a homeless monk
moreover as they heard of the kings going forth all four divisions of the royal army subsequently also went forth
so did the four billion ladies from the royal harem
hearing of these goings forth the townspeople and farmers also went forth
saradvatiputra in short there were eight billion people who thus went forth and
as soon as they had done so they practiced diligently
thus as they all fervently pursued virtuous qualities it did not take them long to acquire the five superknowledges
in that very life and body they all became able to travel by the power of their superknowledges and miraculous abilities traveling east in this way they visited as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river ganges and met as many buddhas before each of them they prayed blessed one please teach the dharma blissful one please turn the wheel of dharma
in that same way they also traveled to the south west and north as well as above and below and in all the intermediate directions in each of those directions they visited as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river ganges and supplicated as many buddhas blessed one please teach the dharma blissful one please turn the wheel of dharma
since then the bodhisattva great being blazing with famed power has never been born in an impure buddha realm nor has he ever taken birth from a womb
whenever he visits a buddha realm all the branches petals leaves trees and forests within that buddha realm will speak of impermanence suffering emptiness and the absence of self
likewise in all the worlds that he visits sentient beings will understand each others languages and they will hear the words of impermanence suffering and the absence of self
thus it was saradvatiputra that the universal emperor blazing with famed power once heard the thusgone royal leader treading with great strength teaching on past roots of virtue and so decided to leave his household to become a homeless monk
sharing his roots of virtue with all beings
he dedicated them toward unexcelled and perfect awakening within that very same body he developed the superknowledges and the power of absorption and so he journeyed to the east visiting as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the river ganges
visiting as many blessed buddhas he stood before them as they resided upon their sacred seat of awakening invoking and supplicating them to turn the wheel of dharma
indeed in this way he traveled in all the ten directions
now saradvatiputra you should not think that the universal emperor blazing with famed power was someone else
because saradvatiputra he is none other than the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin
the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin then proceeded to the city of rajagrha and to the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana where the blessed one was residing going before him
he bowed his head to the blessed ones feet and took a place in the gathering
then he addressed the blessed one with the following words
blessed one the blessed thusgone roar of signlessness inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship and discomfort and whether you remain healthy strong and at ease
and he also sends you this great lotus flower which i request you to accept
at this point the blessed one accepted the lotus flower from the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin and then said to him
noble son does the blessed thusgone roar of signlessness remain strong healthy unchanged and happy within his buddha realm
blessed one answered the bodhisattva great being the thusgone roar of signlessness remains strong healthy unchanged and happy
and why is that
because blessed one in that buddha realm pure beings assemble who are endowed with three factors of purity
what are those three factors
pure roots of virtue as they are dedicated to the truth pure boundless discipline due to aspirations and pure boundless view due to dedication by means of special insight that is not fixed on any phenomenon
blessed one in that buddha realm there is not a single being who has a corrupted discipline view or comportment
blessed one in that buddha realm even the terms for such flaws do not exist
compared to that world blessed one this world known as enduring is like a prison filled with murderers where people are constantly killing each other
come blessed one come along to that other world
in response the blessed one said to the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin
noble son why would i go to that world
it is fine to stay in this world teaching the dharma to beings here
once more the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin called on the blessed one
blessed one come along come along to that world
if blessed one you decline to come along i shall pull you there by the power of my own miraculous abilities and the force of my aspirations
i shall take you through space and into that world
so that the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartins powers would be known and so that sentient beings would engender roots of virtue and become inspired the blessed one at this point remained indifferent
then as if he had become a potter or a potters apprentice who is spinning his wheel with a stick so fast that it blurs visual perception the bodhisattva now transformed the trichiliocosm and lifted it up
as he lifted up the world and shook it the venerable saradvatiputra cried out to the blessed one
blessed one the world is moving
blissful one the world is moving
in response the blessed one spoke in a way that was delightful gentle harmonious pleasant compelling courteous widely agreeable profound comprehensive instructive and guided by wisdom
thus he said to the venerable saradvatiputra saradvatiputra in this regard i am powerless and
he made this known throughout the entire trichiliocosm
hence at this point all beings who were attached to confined to or dependent on the view of the transitory collection became saddened and weary
all four assemblies saw the thusgone one the blessed one the perfect buddha surrounded by bodhisattvas teaching the dharma while residing on the dharma throne like a universal emperor they saw him as brahma the lord of enduring seated upon his brahmathrone and surrounded by brahma deities teaching the dharma
the bodhisattva sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartin now also revealed other buddha realms
then at this point the blessed one performed a miracle
bringing forth a strong swirling wind that caused the buddha realms to touch one another
the worlds became hollow and perforated so that they fell apart and were destroyed
as the thusgone one performed this miraculous feat the brahmas and mahabrahmas of this world who had otherwise conceived in terms of views permanence and the everlasting now witnessed the collapse and complete destruction of their brahma abodes
it was as if a great mass of water had produced an abundance of bubbles and foam which a storm then scattered breaking everything into particles in this way
the brahma deities witnessed the loss demolition and collapse of their abodes
seeing all this they despaired and
in despair they all prostrated to and gathered around the blessed one
then the blessed one said to saradvatiputra
saradvatiputra i have explained this before and i shall now do so again
ah saradvatiputra this worldly existence is defiled and polluted
ah saradvatiputra this world is futile and like an illusion and hence it is like a water bubble that cannot be grasped
ah saradvatiputra this worldly existence is falsely conceived and hence it is like a magic trick
ah saradvatiputra this worldly existence is discerned by the swift thoughts in space and hence it is like a mirage
ah saradvatiputra this worldly existence contains nothing solid to be grasped and hence it is like a hallucination
ah saradvatiputra this worldly existence is conjured up by the actions of thought in space and hence it is like an echo
saradvatiputra this worldly existence is false and by realizing that the thusgone one has attained perfect buddhahood
ah saradvatiputra this worldly existence is fake and so
by not being attached to this world the thusgone one has attained perfect buddhahood
saradvatiputra i have exact knowledge that this worldly existence has no experience to savor and many shortcomings up to having no emancipation
in this way i have full knowledge of how to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
i have exact knowledge of this world saradvatiputra just as i have clear knowledge of its origin and the path that leads to its cessation
at this moment saradvatiputra i possess clear knowledge of how to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
saradvatiputra you may wonder what the world is
saradvatiputra the socalled world is the five aggregates
what are those five
they are the aggregates of form feeling perception formation and consciousness
saradvatiputra you may then wonder what is understood by the aggregate of form
saradvatiputra the thusgone one has relinquished the aggregate of form in all its past future and present manifestations
however while i have relinquished the aggregate of form in all its past future and present manifestations it would be wrong to say that the sentient beings in the past future and present are not the aggregate of form
saradvatiputra whether inner or outer large or small good or bad distant or close the thusgone one teaches that all the aggregate of form as contained within the three times is devoid of characteristics
as an analogy just as the aggregate of space possesses the features of wind water fire and earth the same can be said with respect to the aggregates of form feeling perception formation and consciousness
you may wonder saradvatiputra why it is referred to as the aggregate of form
saradvatiputra childish ordinary beings are in darkness
they do not recognize the full extent and nature of the characteristics of form as found in the body
thus they think instead i am form or form is me
thus they cognize and structure things in terms of i
this produces arrogance and in turn craving for things
yet saradvatiputra when the nature of things is known that is not the case
childish ordinary beings do not comprehend that neither the eye nor form is an entity
instead their thoughts are based on holding on to entities that do not exist as such
childish beings who think in this way thus engage with entities and so take birth within flawed realms
those who thus experience nonentities the colorless that which has no color are indeed greatly bewildered
such bewildered beings pursue agriculture and engage in the use of all sorts of weapons
the factor that conditions them is delusion
due to the sameness of things the thusgone one has a view of sameness having thus gained awakening he has formulated the true view
because that view is equality it is referred to as the true view
it is called the true view because it is adhered to by those who are truly diligent and truly liberated
saradvatiputra the true view that i declare cannot be taught through language
its teaching is hard to bear
practice it saradvatiputra if you do you will also be free of darkness
saradvatiputra this section of the dharma is said to be accompanied by eightyfour thousand dharma teachings
this is the gateway to all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena and
it is the way of all phenomena
when the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha delivered this teaching of the dharma seven hundred and seventy billion beings gained the stainless and immaculate dharma eye that sees all phenomena
within the desire realm a billion gods attained this as did innumerable human beings
among the billions of such humans who lived on jambudvipa those who were bodhisattvas also gained acceptance that phenomena are unborn
innumerably many beings set their minds on unexcelled and perfect awakening
then the blessed one withdrew his miraculous activity and
thus the four assemblies the brahma assembly the assembly of the gods of the desire realm as well as the other gods nagas yaksas gandharvas demigods garudas kimnaras and mahoragas all saw the world as it is
at this point the venerable mahamaudgalyayana rose from his seat draped his shawl over one shoulder and knelt on his right knee
joining his palms he bowed toward the blessed one and said
blessed one the bodhisattva great being sahacittotpadadharmacakrapravartins mastery of supernatural powers is amazing
blessed one he took this world including the blessed one himself and hurled it into another world
at that time i was unable to identify the characteristics and i could not even remember the names of any supernatural powers so needless to mention i was unable to muster any such powers
ah blessed one i find it truly amazing that this bodhisattva possesses such supernatural powers
blessed one when i carefully scan the changing times i do not recognize even a moment or an instant of such hauling and transportation being performed by any of us
if even a bodhisattva can possess such supernatural powers then what to say of the powers of the thusgone ones
replied the blessed one
maudgalyayana you should not think that this world was hauled or that the thusgone one was transported
maudgalyayana i do not perceive any mendicant priest hearer or solitary buddha nor anyone from among the gods up to and including the mahoragas either who is capable of moving even a fold in the thusgone ones dharma robe
what then to say about actually lifting up the thusgone one
that is clearly impossible
for the time being maudgalyayana set aside the world with its gods and imagine instead maudgalyayana the following scenario
within the trichiliocosm there are beings with form just as there are formless beings there are beings involved in perception beings not involved in perception and beings neither involved nor not involved in perception imagine now that they all achieve a human body and with that human body they go forth
having gone forth they also achieve the state of a worthy one and they gain the six superknowledges
maudgalyayana to illustrate this imagine that they gain just as great miraculous abilities as the ones you possess
maudgalyayana what do you think
will that gathering of beings with miraculous abilities then have increased
replied maudgalyayana
yes it will blessed one
maudgalyayana these hearers may lift up a thousandfold universe or millionfold universe or a trichiliocosm and transport it beyond as many universes as there are grains of sand in the river ganges yet
even those who have attained such perfect supernatural powers will not be able to move even a fold in the thusgone ones dharma robe as he resides in the midst of space
maudgalyayana let us leave aside such a gathering of beings like you
imagine instead maudgalyayana that a being has been born who possesses supernatural powers sufficient for conjuring up a storm that can scatter pulverize and destroy any trichiliocosm that has not been blessed by a thusgone one
imagine then that with each of the particles that thus emerge from one trichiliocosm he further plunges universes into darkness and destroys as many of them as there are grains of sand in the river ganges and that the particles emerging thereby are scattered throughout trichiliocosms
maudgalyayana what do you think
would such a being have perfected supernatural power
answered the venerable maudgalyayana
yes blessed one he would
continued the blessed one
maudgalyayana even if this trichiliocosm were full of such beings with perfect supernatural powersas many as there are plants on a field of sugar cane reeds grass paddy or sesamethey would still not be able to move even a fold in the thusgone ones dharma robe
needless it is to mention then that it would be impossible for them to lift up the thusgone one
maudgalyayana while remaining at this very place upon this very lion throne the thusgone one may stir move and shake as many innumerable and unfathomable universes in the east as there are grains of sand in the river ganges
yet the sentient beings there will not think our universe is being dislocated and transported
neither will they think alas this universe is subject to destruction and formation
nor will they think this universe is being scattered and destroyed
however for the sake of taming sentient beings sometimes forms of the buddhas will teach beings the dharma beyond marks
but other times forms of hearers gods humans nagas boys or girls will deliver the teaching
maudgalyayana you must trust in all the different dharma teachings on the buddhas powers fearlessnesses unique qualities and preeminent miracles
this is how it is throughout all the ten directions

maudgalyayana to the monk ananda i have taught the gateways for the retention of the sutras songs prophecies parables pastlife stories elaborate teachings marvels narratives and established teachings however
maudgalyayana the monk ananda is incapable of understanding the domain of the thusgone one
and why is that
because maudgalyayana even if they try for an eon a hundred eons a thousand eons or a hundred thousand eons hearers will not be able to fully understand conceive of or comprehend even a single syllable of the thusgone one
what then to say of their understanding of the thusgone ones full domain
maudgalyayana the thusgone ones instruct sentient beings by means of numerous referents activities and modes of conduct in this way they teach the dharma to sentient beings however
maudgalyayana although wearing the thusgone ones dharma robe accomplishes the aims of all beings and spawns the teaching of the dharma none of the hearers fully comprehend this
maudgalyayana if you cannot even accommodate this teaching then how could you possibly grasp the domain of the thusgone one that is clearly impossible
having thus accepted the great lotus flower the blessed one next posed questions to bhadrapala and all the other bodhisattva great beings who were guardians of the city of dharma
noble sons can you protect the treasure of the thusgone ones dharma can you conceal it can you comprehend the full domain of the thusgone one can you express it can you teach it can you teach it in full
they replied
blessed one yes we can
continued the blessed one
noble sons you should therefore consider whichever dharma teaching you give to be the treasure and domain of the thusgone ones
noble sons all that is expressed with respect to the buddhas perfect wisdom the buddhas perfect awakening the buddhas accomplishment of wisdom and the buddhas accomplishment of awakening is the domain of the thusgone one thus it must be expressed
noble sons wherever an objective referent is seen it is viewed as the thusgone ones domain and definitively taught to be so
that dharma teaching by the thusgone one is delivered by viewing the activities of sentient beings wherever they are seen as the thusgone ones domain
thus the activities of the thusgone ones teaching of the dharma are not displayed for the sake of stopping the activities of sentient beings
the ninetynine thousand faculties of the thusgone ones knowing are as follows the activities of those engaged in desire or anger or delusion the activities of those engaged in contrived desire anger or delusion the activities of those engaged in desire and anger the activities of those engaged in contrived desire and anger
the activities of desire and delusion the activities of those engaged in contrived desire and delusion the activities of those engaged in anger and delusion the activities of those engaged in contrived anger and delusion
the faculties for purifying the mind the faculties for purifying the production of things the faculties for purifying the production of existence the faculties that emerge from application
the faculties for purifying activities the faculties that activate black qualities the faculties that activate white qualities the faculties that activate black and white qualities
the faculties that accord with the path the faculties that accord with tranquility the faculties that accord with special insight
the faculties that accord with exhaustion the faculties that accord with birth and the faculties that accord with the truth
maudgalyayana in this regard the twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct motivate actions that are either black or black and white such actions produce dark complexion fair complexion attractive complexion unattractive complexion crippled legs missing hands or fingers impaired movement deafness blindness or a missing tongue
the twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct also cause shapes that are long short thin fat or indistinct
engaging the faculties of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind the twenty thousand faculties related to the accumulation of past conduct are those associated with desire anger delusion absence of desire absence of anger or absence of delusion
the thirty thousand faculties that produce birth activate the time of death
they become apparent when they create changes or signs
such as shaking of the limbs changes in ones faculties bones breaking or deterioration of the vital signs which in turn causes loss of ones luster these signs finally stop when the voice is choked
such faculties lead to the realms of hell animals or starving spirits
to attain buddhahood one is led to birth among humans gods or within different worlds or one is led to actualize the exhaustion of defilements
there are seventyseven thousand faculties that should be considered if one is interested in the features of roots of virtue
there are twenty thousand faculties that lead to roots of nonvirtue and these should be known to facilitate death
the treasure of the thusgone ones is the domain of the thusgone ones
dwelling within that domain the thusgone one explains the dharma without ever tiring or running out of things to say
this concludes the second chapter
present in the gathering was a certain drdhamatikumarabhuta who now rose from his seat draped his shawl over one shoulder and knelt on his right knee
joining his palms he bowed toward the blessed one and said
blessed one with this gateway of the dharma i have discovered something very precious
blessed one i shall henceforth practice this gateway of the dharma in order to accomplish the dharma
how so
from today on blessed one i shall don a suitable armor to pursue and accomplish these dharma teachings
in the future in times to come i shall never let my diligence wane until i have listened to the dharma treasure of the thusgone ones domain
replied the thusgone one
drdhamati this is excellent it is excellent that throughout innumerable millions of eons you will continue to exert yourself in the pursuit of the practice of my great wisdom
well done drdhamati
now drdhamati imagine that all at once in one moment in one instant all beings in this trichiliocosm without exceptionwhether they are those with form or those who are formless and whether they are those with perception or those without perception or those with neither perception nor nonperceptionwere to attain a human body
then imagine that a man appears who provides all those beings with enjoyable things
he is able to lift them up and hold them by his hand for an eon or more faithfully providing them with whatever forms sounds smells tastes and textures they might wish for
meanwhile he uses his other hand to collect all the feces and urine of all those beings depositing it all in a different universe
and why does he do that
because he does not want any of them to experience any unpleasant odor
drdhamati what do you think
does that man render proper service to all those beings providing them with desirable things
replied drdhamati
indeed blessed one he serves them with an extremely vast amount of enjoyable things
continued the blessed one
drdhamati that man serves each of those beings providing them with pleasant things
now think of a noble son or daughter who regardless of whether the thusgone one is present or has passed beyond suffering develops the mind of unexcelled and perfect awakening for the sake of all beings
this person wishes to hear the teachings of the bodhisattva collection
he or she is intent on accomplishing the wisdom of the buddhas the great wisdom thus eliminating desire anger and delusion so that all beings may go beyond birth aging sickness death lamentation suffering mental pain and disturbance this person pledges to teach the dharma to sentient beings
when thus involved in the process of maturing a bodhisattvas roots of virtue that person may search for the dharma and find just one single verse
drdhamati as that person provides delightful service to sentient beings he or she creates merit that is much larger than the former persons merit the former merit would not even match one hundredth or one thousandth of that
in fact no number fraction enumeration analogy or comparison would suffice
drdhamati the thusgone one is clearly aware of the different ways in which bodhisattva great beings provide delightful service to sentient beings
but who can trust this drdhamati apart from my hearers who have seen the truths or the bodhisattva great beings with their superior intent
drdhamati bodhisattva great beings feel we shall be the support of those who have no support the savior of those who have no savior the refuge of those who have no refuge the protector of those who have no protector
we shall accomplish the wisdom of the buddhas the great wisdom and lead sentient beings beyond all limits and numbers to the undefiled qualities
such is the armor that they wear
it may then be that in the morning they must provide sentient beings with a heap of jewels as large as mount meru and
it may be that they have to do the same at noon and in the afternoon or throughout the day and night
however beings may still not be satisfied and
the gifts may thus become a circumstance for their depravation in that case
bodhisattvas will think we shall pursue the dharma whereby sentient beings will consider the entire trichiliocosm filled with precious substances to be like a glob of spit
needless then to mention what their perception of vile substances will be like
wise bodhisattva great beings will think this heap of jewels is the root of desire anger and delusion the root of the sufferings of hell animals and hungry spirits and the root of numerous karmic manifestations starting out in this way they attain the mind of transcendence of suffering and have no concern for any heap of jewels
in fact wise beings do not consider heaps of jewels to be just that instead
they see them as heaps of beings in hell
because they understand that anyone who develops attachment to such things will fall into misery
now drdhamati let us no longer consider just all the beings within a single trichiliocosm
imagine instead the following
think of all the universes that extend toward the east as abundant as the grains of sand in the river ganges and then think of all the universes that in the same way extend in each of the ten directions within all these universes are beings with bodies beings without bodies beings who are involved in perception beings who are not involved in perception and beings neither involved nor not involved in perception think of all that we in this way call the realms of sentient beings then imagine that all at once each one gains a human body
imagine also that a man appears who always immediately provides them with whatever they might wish for in terms of enjoyable forms sounds smells tastes and textures
for an eon or more that man takes care of all these beings carrying them on his shoulders and head
whatever they wish him to do he does and
with one hand he sweeps away all these beings excrement and urine disposing of it all in a different universe
well drdhamati what do you think
does that man render proper service to those beings providing them with numerous desirable things
replied drdhamati
indeed blessed one he serves them with a vast amount of enjoyable things
continued the blessed one
drdhamati pay attention and understand what i say
that man serves all those beings providing them with pleasant things
but think now of a noble son or daughter who wishes to provide all beings with refuge and so sets his or her mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
this person wishes to listen to the teachings of the bodhisattva collection the teachings whereby bodhisattvas roots of virtue ripen into unexcelled and perfect awakening and may therefore diligently pursue the dharma of the bodhisattvas
if drdhamati that person takes even just a single step toward the pursuit and diligent practice of the bodhisattva dharma then the ensuing roots of virtue will not wear out or come to an end before the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening
and why
drdhamati the former persons way of providing delightful service cannot match even one hundredth or a thousandth one hundred thousandth or a millionth part of what is rendered by the latter in fact no number fraction enumeration analogy or comparison would suffice
and why
because drdhamati all of the former type of service is based on substance and hence is limited and imperfect
drdhamati diligent pursuit of the dharma causes an increase in discipline absorption and insight
it ripens the qualities of buddhahood
it ripens inconceivable skillful means and purifies buddha realms
hence the thusgone one has taught that unexcelled and perfect awakening depends on abundant learning
drdhamati imagine that this trichiliocosm is full of thusgone onesas full as a grove of reeds a paddy field a sesame field or a bamboo grove
imagine then that someone spends his or her entire life paying respect to honoring venerating and worshiping all those thusgone ones worthy ones perfect buddhas offering them garments foods bedding mattresses medicines and other material things
moreover if any one of those thusgone ones passes completely beyond suffering that person will construct a memorial for them that measures a league in circumference is made of the seven precious substances is sheltered below parasols is adorned with altars shines for an eon with the blazing light of oil lamps and is adorned with beautiful offerings
drdhamati what do you think
will such a noble son or daughter engender abundant merit
replied drdhamati
blessed one that person will produce merit beyond number and measure
drdhamati said the blessed one try to imagine and understand this
that person indeed accumulates such merit
however a noble son or daughter may develop the mind set on unexcelled and perfect awakening and so diligently seek to listen to teach read and master the sutra teachings of the bodhisattva collection the teachings that ripen the factors of awakening
in this regard drdhamati the heaps of merit that are acquired by the former person cannot match even one hundredth or a thousandth a hundred thousandth or a billionth part of the mass of merit that is achieved by this latter person in fact no number fraction enumeration analogy or comparison would suffice
therefore drdhamati if you intend to don your armor for the sake of listening to recollecting reading and mastering such sutras in the future during the final five hundred years then drdhamati i shall not state any measure regarding the amount of merit that you will obtain
i shall mention neither limits nor an end to it
drdhamati if you wish to hear an analogy for the amount of merit that is obtained by developing the awakened mind or if you wish to gain just a sense of what it is like then
let me ask you whether you have heard of the thusgone ones supernatural powers and if you are capable of believing in them
replied drdhamati
blessed one i can accept the powers of the blessed one
asked the blessed one
drdhamati what do you think
is the trichiliocosm large
replied drdhamati
blessed one yes it is
asked the blessed one
drdhamati what do you think
what if the trichiliocosm were full of sesame seeds and each of those sesame seeds itself became a container the size of a trichiliocosm all filled up with sand
drdhamati what do you think
would all that amount to a large pile of sand
replied drdhamati
yes blessed one it would
continued the blessed one
drdhamati what then if a man appeared who would grab handfuls of this sand and toss it in the four directions and if whenever he did so a wind would catch each individual grain of sand and carry it into its own distinct universe
drdhamati what do you think
how many worlds would there be in the east and
how many would there be in the other directions
replied drdhamati
blessed one this would be beyond measure
blissful one it would be beyond measure
continued the blessed one
drdhamati try to imagine
drdhamati try to understand
drdhamati in the case of the thusgone ones the worthy ones the perfect buddhas their conduct path transcendent discipline transcendent miraculous abilities and transcendent insight are all beyond measure
drdhamati if he so wishes a thusgone one may traverse all those universes in a single step and yet
neither will his conduct be rushed
nor will he have displayed the full extent of his transcendent supernatural powers
within the time of a fingersnap and with just one single step a thusgone one can walk across all those universesone universe for each grain of sand
he can do so in the east as well as in all the rest of the ten directions and
he can do so for a day a fortnight a month a year a hundred years a thousand years or a hundred thousand years
he can walk throughout each direction for a hundred billion years
well drdhamati would you say that the worlds that can thus be crossed by a thusgone one are many
replied drdhamati
yes blessed one they are many
continued the blessed one
drdhamati if such merit had form it could not even be contained within all those universes
it would be even larger
drdhamati the thusgone ones the worthy ones the perfect buddhas know all these heaps of merit completely
such merits are beyond measure innumerable limitless ineffable and beyond count and yet the thusgone one knows them completely
drdhamati i am not aware of any number of syllables or any number of letters or any number of digits that can convey the knowledge of such heaps of merit
in the end there would be nothing but innumerable numbers numbers beyond measure
this concludes the third chapter
at that time there was in the eastbeyond countless and limitless universesa world known as sound of renown within that universe resided a thusgone one a worthy one a perfect buddha known as majestic mountain
abiding and remaining present there he taught the dharma
the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha majestic mountain had just prophesied that following himself the bodhisattva luminous sphere of great splendor who was present in the gathering there would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
the bodhisattva luminous sphere of great splendor had witnessed the great light heard the special sound and sensed the ground quaking
now he approached the blessed thusgone majestic mountain and asked
blessed one who is behind this light this special sound and the ground shaking
the blessed one the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha majestic mountain then said to the bodhisattva luminous sphere of great splendor
noble son to the west of this buddha realm far beyond countless and limitless universes there is a world known as enduring
there resides the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha sakyamuni
abiding and remaining present there he is delivering dharma teachings on the bodhisattva collection to a retinue that contains incomparable bodhisattva beings
noble son in the ten directions throughout universes as numerous as the grains of sand in the river ganges there is nobody who wears an armor as strong as the one that is borne by those holy beings
noble son even coming to hear of these beings is extremely difficult let alone beholding and venerating them
said the bodhisattva luminous sphere of great splendor
blessed one i wish to go to that world known as enduring so that i may see venerate and serve the blessed thusgone sakyamuni and so that i may see those bodhisattva great beings who bear such inconceivable armor
noble son if you know that the time has come then go replied the blessed majestic mountain
offer that blessed one these seven lotus flowers and
tell him that the blessed thusgone majestic mountain inquires whether he has encountered but little hardship and discomfort and whether he remains healthy strong and at ease
the bodhisattva great being luminous sphere of great splendor then looked at the thusgone majestic mountain
he bowed his head to the thusgone ones feet and then left
as fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm the bodhisattva luminous sphere of great splendor now disappeared from that universe and instantaneously appeared here in the world of enduring
arriving at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha he went before the blessed one
he bowed his head to the blessed ones feet and sat to one side
then he addressed the blessed one
blessed one the blessed thusgone majestic mountain inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort and whether you remain healthy strong and at ease
he also sends you these lotus flowers
the blessed one accepted the flowers and asked
luminous sphere of great splendor is that blessed one free from ailments is he strong and does he remain unchanged and happy
replied luminous sphere of great splendor
yes blessed one
he is free from ailments and strong he remains unchanged and happy within his buddha realm
the blessed one now gave the lotus flowers to the bodhisattva ajita and said ajita so that you may perfect the branches of awakening take these lotuses and use them to engender roots of virtue
the bodhisattva ajita receiving thus the seven great lotus flowers in turn passed them on to bhadrapala and other such incomparable bodhisattvas
including ratnakara susarthavaha nadadatta indradatta varuna balabhadra uttaramati visesamati vardhamanamati amoghadarsin susamprasthita suvikrantavikramin nityodyukta aniksiptadhura suryagarbha jagatimdhara dharanidhara able intelligence anantamati trailokyavikramin anantavikramin unfathomable subduer leader revealing all objects of perception drdhamati aprameyavikramin meaningful diligence lion of powerful diligence moving with the power of meaningful steps joyous acumen tiksnapratibhana gambhirapratibhana boundless acumen aprameyapratibhana manjusrikumarabhuta padmagarbha elephant of infinity knowing neither increase nor decrease dharmodgata ratnapani meaningful glory immovable subjugator asoka vigatasoka engagement without difference untiring diligence becoming a womb strivivarta becoming a man becoming a sentient being jaliniprabha infinite essence lotus in the buddhas hand padmapani gandhahasti armor of lionlike understanding meaningful armor irreproachable armor armor of entering all realms armor of profound conduct bearer of the armor beyond change and free from weariness spreader of flowers jewel flower clarifier of the meaningful name propagator of the meaningful name bearer of the armor of all objects of perception bearer of the armor of constant joy bearer of the armor of constant longing bearer of the armor of impartiality bearer of the armor of glorious equality bearer of the fierce force of joy force of benevolence sriharsa nandika actualizing the branches of awakening bearer of the armor of never parting from the buddhas bearer of the armor of turning the dharma wheel bearer of the armor of the unimpeded wheel bearer of the armor of total relinquishment bearer of the armor of nonappropriation bearer of the armor of being unperturbed bearer of the armor of keeping the lineage of the buddhas unbroken candravaloka glorious light of qualities sarthavaha mahasarthavaha supreme accumulations supreme array ratnavyuha sarvasiddhartha meaningful splendor glorious guidance guiding victory banner certain guidance santa perfector buddhabhadra supriya joyous victor jitendriya jayasena crushing subduer satrumardana without malice toward enemies universally renowned king of fame increasing wealth mitra divine friend growing friend bearer of the single parasol ratnacchatra sunaksatra dharma dharmadeva vimala stainless hero moving with heroic strength moving with infinite strength moving with meaningful strength subduer with infinite steps treading with tremendous power and action beyond differences thus in all seventyseven thousand bodhisattvas received the seven lotus flowers the blessed one said elders the blessed one gives you these seven lotuses so that you may bring the factors of awakening to maturation
noble sons take these great flowers transform them and offer them to the blessed one
as you transform the flowers display your individual skillful means
thus when the seventyseven thousand bodhisattvas had taken the seven lotus flowers they offered them to the blessed one so that they could each display their skillful means
with great love the blessed one accepted the seven great lotuses and then said to the bodhisattva great being ajita
ajita the thusgone one has practiced diligently so that you may give rise to roots of virtue
he has practiced with supreme diligence
ajita a thusgone one a blessed one a perfect buddha is extremely difficult to find supremely difficult to find
ajita bodhisattvas are also extremely difficult to find
and why
because ajita buddha qualities manifest from bodhisattva activity
ajita would i now possess the ten powers of a thusgone one if i had not earlier aroused the mind of awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one you would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would the four types of fearlessness be present now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
blessed one they would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would the great love of the thusgone one be present in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one it would not be present
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would the great compassion of the thusgone one be present in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
or would there be any great joy or great equanimity
replied ajita
no blessed one there would be none of these
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would there be any of the eighteen unique qualities of the buddha in the world now if i had not earlier when i was engaged in bodhisattva activity set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one there would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would any of the thusgone ones meaningful strides be manifest in the world now if i had not earlier when i was engaged in bodhisattva activity set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one they would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
could the lions gait of the thusgone one be witnessed in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one it could not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would the thusgone ones elephant gaze be manifest in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one it would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would the lionlike posture of the thusgone one be seen in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one it would not be
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would the thusgone ones indiscernible crown protuberance appear in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one it would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would any of the thirtytwo marks of a great being be perceptible in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one there would be none
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would i turn the wheel of dharma in the world now if had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one you would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would the conch of dharma be present in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
blessed one it would not
asked the blessed one
ajita what do you think
would there be perfect hearers in the world now if i had not earlier set my mind on unexcelled and perfect awakening
replied ajita
no blessed one there would not
the blessed one continued
thus ajita each and every element of awakening depends on the initial engendering of that mind
ajita the reason there are so few thusgone ones is that bodhisattvas are so rare
ajita consider this analogy if there were no butter there would no longer be any clarified butter likewise
ajita if the mind is not set on awakening one will never become a thusgone one
ajita consider this analogy when there is butter there is also an uninterrupted supply of clarified butter similarly
ajita when there are bodhisattvas in the world there will also be thusgone ones
ajita consider this analogy when there is a seed there can also be a sprout likewise ajita if there are bodhisattvas in the world there will also be thusgone ones
ajita the reason thusgone ones are so rare is therefore precisely because bodhisattvas are rare
ajita consider this analogy compared to the priceless jewels in the ocean there is a greater number of valuable jewels in general similarly
among sentient beings there are only a few who abide by the mind of awakening
in comparison those who keep the mindset of a hearer or a solitary buddha are so many
thus ajita those who give rise to the mind of awakening are rare they are extremely rare
being so extremely rare they are like the udumbara flower
those who engender the mind of awakening are priceless like priceless jewels
those who engender the mind of awakening are greatly superior like mount meru
those who engender the mind of awakening are utterly unmoving like space
those who engender the mind of awakening are deep like the ocean
ajita those who engender the mind of awakening surpass a trichiliocosm filled with precious jewels
ajita when those who engender the mind of awakening have a physical form they are worthy of homage and
ajita they will be protected by hundreds of thousands of mundane beingsgods and others
therefore ajita persist in the practice of engendering the awakened mind do so joyfully forcefully clearly boldly and with commitment
ajita you may then wonder what it means to engender the mind of awakening
arousing the mind of awakening is not something that can be counted or measured
nevertheless ajita for the sake of comprehension i shall give you just an illustration just a single example
long ago in the past before limitless and innumerable eons there was a thusgone one a worthy one a perfect buddha someone wise and virtuous a blissful one a knower of the world a steersman taming beings an unsurpassable one a teacher of gods and humans a blessed buddha by the name of king of bliss
ajita the lifespan of that blessed one was eightyfour thousand years
ajita the first assembly of that blessed ones hearers numbered seven hundred sixty million
the second assembly contained nine hundred sixty million and the third one billion hearers
without exception they were all foedestroyers who had brought an end to defilement completed their task completed their work laid down the load achieved their own objectives exhausted the bonds to existence and achieved liberation through the mind of equality
at that time there was a royal palace known as immense vista and within that palace resided a king of royal descent who had received anointment he was known by the name of lion glory and
his eminent queen gave birth to two twin boys one named asoka and the other vigatasoka
ajita one day in the palace when the two boys had grown to be seven years old they saw the thusgone king of bliss enter the royal palace together with a gathering of hearers
the boy asoka then asked his brother
vigatasoka do you see the thusgone one the blessed one the perfect buddha king of bliss as he approaches from afar
replied vigatasoka
yes brother i see him
continued asoka
vigatasoka i want to become just like the thusgone one the blessed one the perfect buddha king of bliss
prince asoka then spoke the following verses to his brother
behold the protector supreme among humans as he heads the sangha of monks leading them here vigatasoka watch king of bliss
the one thing i must do is to become just such a perfect leader of men
i shall engender the mind of awakening and liberate beings from fear
through craving conceit anger and desire the world engages in painful acts
through such acts they fall into the abyss of hell
yet i shall free them from the lower realms
i shall be the worlds guide like the udumbara flowers of the world this is the rarest of the rare this is the wish you should make
in reply his brother vigatasoka spoke the following verses
even if words are many they do not make things happen
i remain in practice and say nothing at all
if despite so much talking the body does nothing
it is all fruitless and the words become lies
if words would make things happen people would shine like a jewel
although their good qualities decrease they declare themselves to be supreme
young asoka then spoke these verses to his brother vigatasoka
it is for the sake of oneself and not others that one would say such things
therefore if one does not say anything at all ones mind is suffering from stinginess
i invite sentient beings to be my guests
i shall delight them
for me there is no stinginess to get rid of
may i be the guide of living beings
the wise ones of the past did not say such things
some speak at great length but do not act accordingly
such people were also stingy in the past
hence they wonder whether things are actually going to happen
young vigatasoka then spoke again to his brother in verse
brother we should go together to ask the protector whether your way of developing the mind of awakening or mine is the greatest
young vigatasoka then descended from the upper story of the palace and
wearing sandals made of jewels and garments worth millions
he went to the place where the thusgone king of bliss was residing
there he bowed his head to the thusgone ones feet and took a place in the gathering
young asoka on the other hand jumped from the upper story and in this way went before the thusgone king of bliss
he also wore precious garments and he carried a jewel as his crown ornament
but as he arrived asoka offered his garments and jewel to the blessed one and the blessed one accepted those gifts from the boys hand
in this way young vigatasoka in fact arrived in the blessed ones presence later than young asoka who had gotten there much earlier
when vigatasoka noticed young asoka in the gathering around the thusgone king of bliss he asked him
asoka which way did you take to have arrived here before the thusgone one the blessed one the perfect buddha king of bliss so much earlier
replied asoka
brother i jumped from our palace to this place where the blessed one resides
without any harm or injury to my body i got here with great convenience
when he had heard young asoka s reply young vigatasoka offered his sandals and precious garments to the blessed one and spoke the following verse
may we not take inferior paths but behold the guide of the world
may we always follow the path taught by the buddhas
in verse young asoka then addressed his brother
people who protect their bodies and lives are constantly looking for the path
brother you are just like such people
those always in pursuit of happiness do not pursue the happiness of others
when they leave their present body and life they come to suffer in numerous ways
we must be of great service to people and liberate them from the web of suffering
that very path leads to seeing buddhahood when buddhahood is seen one will no longer search for the path
we shall take the path that leads to happiness thus think ignorant and unwise people
yet they proceed on such inferior paths
they do not know the true path
those traveling inferior paths while thinking of the ultimate proceed along paths of misfortune tied up by the demons as they are such people are far from this supreme path
may we always meet with buddhas
may we always wear the ochre colors
may we always observe pure conduct
may our lives be extremely beneficial to others
may we always abide by the practice of the sacred dharma
may we always uphold the dharma
may we retain the dharma of all the victorious ones forever
may we always do good to living beings
may we constantly foster steadfast diligence
may we never let the words we hear be wasted
may our equipoise be constant
and may we forever be adorned with all excellent qualities
ajita when young asoka and young vigatasoka had spoken these verses
they both went forth from their homes to become monks under the thusgone king of bliss
as soon as they had gone forth each one of them claimed that he would become a thusgone one much earlier than the other
the monk asoka then asked the monk vigatasoka
what sort of mindset have you aroused since you claim that you will be the first to awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood
replied vigatasoka
asoka i think in this way until i have awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood i shall never give up the mind of awakening even if i must bring every single being to maturation by remaining in hell for a hundred thousand eons
such is the quality of the mind that i bring forth
asoka even if people come from the east and from all the other directions and place upon my head piles of feces fire or dirt or a pot of excrement fire or dirt
i shall not allow that to make me angry and lose my temper
i shall not scowl angrily at such people
nor shall i speak spitefully of revenge
instead i shall practice the perfections for the sake of those very people who attack me
therefore all their acts serve only to generate the wisdom of the buddhas
all their acts serve only to engender the qualities of the buddhas
if i in the face of such abuse were to abandon my equipoise then
how would i be able to accomplish the perfection of patience
what should be extraordinary about this if such circumstances for ill will would not come up
therefore in order to mature those very beings and cause them to pass beyond suffering i shall don my armor thinking in this way i bear the armor of patience
if when such beings seek to harm me i attempt to retaliate then how would i be any better than them
asoka such is the armor that i bear
the monk asoka then said to the monk vigatasoka
brother have you seen that mind of yours which bears such armor
the monk vigatasoka replied
if there were no mind there would not be any donning of such armor either
if there were no armor then neither could it be shown
asoka because there is mind the armor can also be shown
the monk asoka then told the monk vigatasoka
you must not say just as there is mind there is also armor
and why not
because vigatasoka the mind is subject to arising and destruction and is therefore like an illusion
and an illusory mind that is subject to arising and destruction is neither there nor not there
vigatasoka a view is involved whether something is there or not and any such view of presence or absence is a wrong view
whenever there is wrong view one is on an errant path a wrong path
one is not on the path of awakening and hence one is far from awakening not near it
reaching awakening will be hard
therefore vigatasoka all that is mental construction
anything that involves mental construction and conceit is not something for a bodhisattva to rely on
what then should a bodhisattva rely on
a bodhisattva should not rely on anything
and why not
because if one relies on something one does not properly rely
thus a bodhisattva should not be attached to anything
and why not
because awakening is baseless
and should a bodhisattva conceptualize this that would not be right
why not
because awakening is beyond concepts
if a bodhisattva should become fixed on this that would not be right
why not
because awakening is beyond fixation
should a bodhisattva think in such ways that would not be right
why not
because awakening knows no concepts
if a bodhisattva determines this that would not be right
why not
because awakening has no characteristics
if a bodhisattva comprehends this that would not be right
and why not
because awakening does not change
should a bodhisattva believe that there is something to actualize
that would not be right
and why not
because there is no awakening and because awakening is beyond syllables
the monk vigatasoka then said to the monk asoka
asoka why should there not be any awakening
let me explain
vigatasoka is here and since i am here there is also awakening
replied the monk asoka
brother please do not think that nonconceptual awakening either exists or does not exist
and why
because as long as there are concepts there is no awakening
and why
because awakening does not involve any concepts
this is how it is
or in other words the more constructs the more awakening
said vigatasoka
brother i do not understand what you mean by saying the more constructs the more awakening
the monk asoka then said to his brother
brother for that reason let us together go before the blessed thusgone king of bliss
the two of them then went to the place where the blessed thusgone king of bliss was residing
having bowed their heads to his feet they sat to one side and
from there they conveyed their entire conversation to the blessed one
in response the blessed one expressed his approval to the one monk saying excellent asoka
the blessed one then turned to vigatasoka and said
vigatasoka this is how it is
the more constructs the more awakening
why
because all constructs are void and so is awakening
what then is voidness
voidness is a construct
and what are constructs
they are thought
that is to say there are the constructs of form feeling perception formation and consciousness the constructs of discipline and absorption the constructs of few desires and contentment and the constructs of being easily satisfied and being distinct
where do constructs come from
they come from thinking that is to say from the thought of form to the thought of absorptioneach thought is construction
whatever is thought has no form and thus thinking is not something with form
that which is thought is absence of thought
that which is thought is neither discipline nor anything else up to and including contentment
and awakening is the emptiness of form
awakening is the emptiness of feeling perception formation and consciousness
so also with discipline absorption few desires contentment being easily satisfied and being easily nourishedall are emptiness
and emptiness is neither sameness nor difference
that precisely is what awakening is
when the monk vigatasoka heard this teaching of the dharma he gained the acceptance that phenomena do not arise
he also clearly understood what kind of mind makes someone a bodhisattva he understood what the mind of awakening is
in this way the monks asoka and vigatasoka developed special insight into and clear knowledge of all phenomena with such conviction about all phenomena they persisted diligently without any weariness or sleepiness for eighty thousand years
whereas before they had always been involved in nothing but the pursuit of their desires
thus they did not give rise to any desire anger or dullness
upon their death and passing their next birth in the world took place in the buddha realm known as harmony with a thousand buddha realms the realm of the thusgone samvrttaskandha and
there they continued their diligent pursuits
ajita in this way those two bodhisattvas went on to serve six hundred and eighty million buddhas and
in each life they lived they would always go forth and practice diligently
then finally the bodhisattva great being asoka awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and appeared in the world as the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha known as array of the perfect assembly
after that the bodhisattva vigatasoka awakened to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and he became the thusgone one the worthy one the perfect buddha known as supreme accumulations
ajita the teachings of those two became extremely vast
ajita the lifespans of those two thusgone ones were unfathomably long
ajita the mind of a bodhisattva is not transferred anywhere nor is it adopted in any way
it cannot be engendered and it cannot be stopped it does not abide
it cannot be interrupted it does not come and it does not go
ajita that mind as well as the bodhisattva is supremely difficult to find
then the blessed one spoke the following verses
throughout millions of eons the world illuminators are so rare
like the flowers of the udumbara they appear in the world only sometimes
also bodhisattvas who practice in pursuit of awakening are rare
the heros mind will manifest in the world only sometimes
thus the ones who bring forth such an extremely pure mind will witness the powers of a buddha as well as the types of fearlessness
they will roar like a lion and declare the speech of the sage
as i turn the wheel of truth they will turn the wheel of dharma
my eighteen unique qualities complete without anything lacking as well as all the marks of the buddhas you must look here to see them
the movements free from delusion the elephants gaze and the imperceptible crown all must all be seen through that mind
transcendent discipline transcendent meditative absorption transcendent insight as well as the mind of awakening are all to be seen through this
all buddha qualities and any other qualities taught reside without exception within that mind and within its initial arousal
the discipline of the hearers the absorptions of the hearers and their insight and miraculous ability you must see them all here
if you do not engage the mind that you earlier brought forth then
how will you ever be able to engage the unexcelled wisdom
if the buddha qualities are not seen then how could there be any hearing
the hearers then could not possibly appear within the world
the armor of the virtues of sufferings transcendence just as it is borne by the perfect solitary buddhas also that you must see through this mind
all the happiness of sentient beings whether mundane or transcendent resides without exception within this mind and within the initial mind
that minds ripening is vast and it is said that once seen it will not wear out even over billions of eons
arising and ceasing the mind is brought forth by conditions
watch the ripening of its empty nature
the mind is produced by conditions but the mind itself is not an entity
watch the ripening by the mind that is devoid of any entity
based on what is apprehended the mind never arises yet
watch the ripening of that which is praised for never decaying
how could a person of steadfast mind who clearly understands such a mind and constantly remains within the true vehicle ever be lost
there are those who remain fixed on eye and form as well as feeling perception and formation and who do not know their own nature
such miserable minds that believe that by thinking they can purify space will for long not experience any purification and so they will remain unskilled within existence
therefore the mind is false and fake
having understood that it does not exist
do not ascribe to it any importance
for it is devoid of any essence
the mind that arises in dependence will never come to nothing
yet all its conditions are empty of their own essence
phenomena empty of their own essence are not to be accomplished
all phenomena are imaginary
this is how their nature is taught
those who understand this clearly receive the prophecy of awakening
their prophecy is not delivered by means of form nor does it take place in terms of feeling
prophecy does not occur through perception or formation nor is it granted by means of consciousness
here no phenomena are observed yet neither do such beings lack prophecy
those who recognize that here all phenomena are devoid of marks and who are free from arrogance based on such understanding they receive the prophecy of awakening
such acceptance has arisen through precisely the teaching of intelligence
as dirt is broken weapons are broken and thus they will not be subject to forgetfulness
whoever truly develops an acceptance of this kind will be able to endure wealth and honor
remaining free from conceit based on riches
an acceptance of this kind is undertaken by the wise
having subdued the two extremes the wise practice by means of the middle
hence one must develop firm acceptance
phenomena are devoid of essence this is the path of awakening upon which i have also relied
this concludes the fourth chapter

all the lotus petals and jewels would shine with a constant brilliance and yet their light was eclipsed by that of the blessed one

there he went to the place where the blessed thusgone sakyamuni was residing bowed his head to the blessed ones feet in homage and said

this blessed one had prophesied that a bodhisattva great being known as bearer of the armor of courage that comes from roots of virtue definitively directed toward allseeing buddhahood would awaken to unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood
that bodhisattva great being had also noticed the great light and heard the sound of the clear voice
he therefore went before that blessed one bowed his head to his feet and asked
blessed one whose is this radiance and clear voice
replied the blessed one
noble son in the west beyond a thousand innumerable universes lies a universe known as enduring
within it resides the thusgone sakyamuni
abiding and remaining present there he is delivering dharma teachings of the bodhisattva collection
what you witness is his power
the bodhisattva bearer of the armor of courage that comes from roots of virtue definitively directed toward allseeing buddhahood then addressed that blessed one
blessed one i wish to go to that world of enduring so that i may see venerate and serve the blessed thusgone sakyamuni and listen to his teachings
replied the blessed one
noble son if you know that the time has come then leave
then the bodhisattva bearer of the armor of courage that comes from roots of virtue definitively directed toward allseeing buddhahood took up eight lotus flowers and cast them toward the world of enduring and the place where the blessed one was residing
the lotuses passed through all the universes and landed precisely at the kalandakanivapa in the venuvana by rajagrha right where the blessed one was residing
as the gatherings of the fourfold retinue of the blessed thusgone sakyamuni beheld the lotuses they were filled with wonder
the lotuses circled around the blessed one three times and then landed before him
as soon as the blessed one touched the lotuses with his right hand the bodies of bodhisattvas emerged from them
those bodhisattvas then recited the following verses of praise after which they disappeared
master of infinite knowledge foremost leader limitless and selfexisting you comprehend all phenomena
how vast are your infinite miracles
all the realms of the world you illumine
having heard the name of the buddha
all these wise beings have made requests and expressed their wishes and so they have arrived here through their supernatural powers that they might see and venerate the buddha
the heroes present who wear the robes of awakening remaining here in the world of enduring are held back by just a single birth and endowed with superior names bodies and fame
the armor they bear makes them fearless and so they apply themselves to mature others
of the supreme guide for the world they ask how he reached supreme awakening
to the question of why you first pursued the dharma
you reply that it was to conquer the maras and attain awakening thus when requested by these emanated beings sakyamuni replies
our guide explains in words of truth
as they hear the words of the one supreme among humans
they become delighted and content and rejoice prostrate to the blissful one and happily take their seats
as the emanations disappear from where they were they proceed to ask questions of the thusgone one
when they are asked about where they are from and what their names are the hairs on the bodies of the retinue stand on end
when the fourfold retinue feels disinclined to ask questions of the victorious one out of respect
the protector of the world will send forth emanations and
thus the monk anandabhadra appeared
having asked his questions to the protector he vanished and disappeared
who are these beings and to whom do they belong
please explain o protector and dispel our doubts
behold the armor of beings endowed with aspiration and courage
these beings have arrived here by the blessing of that armor
they have arrived from the east traveling across innumerable universes
the heroes who have come here for the good of the world have arrived with great consideration
their intentions are pure and they act for the sake of awakening such is the character of their aspirations
their virtue ensures their vision of buddhahood and
they will not feel dejection here
nor will their discipline weaken
for they are learned and master superior transcendences
their skill in means is extremely vast
without entering the womb they remain in samsara from one life to the next without ever forgetting the continuum of the mind of dharma
constantly they encounter the buddhas
constantly they keep company with the noble
thus when the beings here behold such heroes it constantly leads to the attainment of deliverance
the virtue that ensues from seeing such beings will immediately surpass untold amounts of other forms of virtue
the qualities of these heroic beings are famed in numerous ways yet ultimately immutable
when the name of such a perfect hero is heard by a woman
she will never again become female but always be a holy being of the highest kind
when men or women hear their name they become happy and form the aspiration to be born in that buddhafield
when their body dies they will indeed take birth there
thus being born into a perfect realm
whenever a man woman or anyone else hears their name and feels faith they will never regress from the pursuit of awakening
apart from the beings that go naked anyone who hears that name yet feels no joy and does not receive any word from a buddha either will nevertheless become endowed with merit
just as when an elixir dispels all flaws whoever intentionally listens to that name will thereby also come to see them and without doubt achieve certainty regarding the nature of awakening
if someone takes the leaves of the palasa tree and produces elixirs from them
then the power of such medicine will ensure that one remains unharmed by fire
if a fierce and potent snake venom is used to neutralize poison and this method taught across the earth
then why would anyone dig for such medicine
if brought to smell snake venom all snakes will die
similarly people who resemble such a medicinal elixir will perform buddha deeds by means of their names
whoever hears the names of such heroes as they resound in all directions will thereby be affected
thus no woman will touch such beings
and so they will obviously be held in esteem and respected
the monk who is an emanation of the victorious ones and is known by the name anandabhadra a name given to him by the victorious ones is someone to whom anyone in pursuit of awakening should turn
anandabhadra the one with a name of excellent armor as i now hear that he is in this world i shall pronounce his name undauntedly
beings of lesser virtue who find it hard to trust the profound teaching of the blissful ones and the victorious ones awakening have arrived
now my life will last only for a short while
ananda there are supreme beings who have arrived in this retinue only today
the fame of the armor of those world protectors who have arrived here is unstoppable throughout the ten directions
ananda bhadrapala ratnakara ratnakara susarthavaha gunagupta pravina as well as hero and balabhadrabehold them all
water varuna and bhadrapala along with the monks who all are protectorsbehold them all
their armor is inconceivable
those famed under the name amogha are all bearers of the meaningful armor and
they are all meaningful to behold
so what need to mention serving them
ananda whoever sees them or hears their names can never be turned back from awakening and will never fall into the lower realms
all of them will gather with diligence
all of them will gather with insight
all of them will observe the body of discipline and
all of them will thus venerate the supreme vehicle
ananda all heroes in this buddhafield and throughout the worlds of the ten directions who aspire to that armor will be praised by all the victorious ones
the victorious ones who bring forth such praises will then be known to the bodhisattvas
thus they behold the leader of the sakyas the protector of the world as well as the heroes in pursuit of awakening
having heard this they supplicate and the protector is present in the world of enduring
having circumambulated the bodies of the victorious ones
all these bodhisattvas have arrived here
the monk who hears their names will develop the wish for supreme awakening and
the one who pursues awakening through names and wishes will receive the prophecy of awakening from the victorious ones
people who have acted in unvirtuous ways throughout innumerable eons will for this reason in the dark age journey to buddha realms together with me
even though i attain this supreme awakening
i will have no joy in seeing sentient beings at that time
the monks who will appear in the future will be savage wild and brutal
those who then having heard of the terrors again and again bring forth the power of diligence and offer raw food at times of starvation possess a savage generosity
those who here show great respect thinking in the future times of great fear i must do what is meaningful even at the cost of my life will propagate and uphold my supreme dharma
at that time the aspirations associated with unvirtuous acts will remain and be present in the world
those who now engage in such acts will also at that time be flawed
when they then hear a dharma such as this
they will believe that it is not the dharma declaring the victorious one did not teach this
behold the errors of the world ananda
the monks who train will then become saddened by the thought that conditioned things never last
as if their heads had caught fire they will focus all their efforts on attaining the deathless
hearing of the destruction of the teachings even the gods will experience suffering
appalled by the sights of destruction they will feel that even dying would be easier
today we perceive such a great sage who dauntlessly makes proclamations
we behold the countenance of the supreme guide and as we beseech him to teach we rejoice
likewise do we witness monks who practice concentration
who have gained mastery and possess skill through supernatural powers who have accomplished transcendent absorption and insight
how might we in the future be able to see any of that
evil monks will be the ones in power and
those of discipline will be destroyed quickly coming to live within a household
at that time the gods will be extremely displeased
alas alas the teachings will be destroyed
those who then commit themselves and undertake hardships will be subdued by evil monks
behold this destruction of the teachings
while people enjoy each other they will defame the gentle ones
they will raise disagreements with the buddha and take up the life of a householder
mixing with female lay practitioners they will act in the same way as them
those who become disrespectful of the buddhas teaching will also abandon supreme awakening
they bring the worst harm upon the three jewels thus they will be shunned by the honorable
such unworthy beings who defame the leader will likewise be shunned by those who have discipline
at that time those of discipline will be blamed and monks will be brought down by evil
at that time of great fear and perversion you must develop sadness and be careful
arouse diligence in the teaching of the blissful one
at that time there will be great terrors
do not associate with evil monks
that time will be one of suffering
as fast as an athlete can stretch out or bend an arm the bodhisattva bearer of the armor of courage that comes from roots of virtue definitively directed toward allseeing buddhahood now disappeared from that universe in an instant and emerged here in the world of enduring
he proceeded to the place where the blessed thusgone sakyamuni was residing bowed his head to the blessed ones feet in homage and said
blessed one the blessed leader who displays the body of the buddhas to all maras inquires whether you have encountered but little hardship or discomfort and whether you remain healthy strong and at ease
replied the blessed one
