at a time when the king of anga and his armies were dominant
he called up the four branches of his armed forces

at other times king mahapadma and his armies were dominant
at times the king of anga and his armies were dominant
while the bodhisattva was dwelling in the abode of tusita
meanwhile king mahapadma ruled over the lands of magadha under his rule the kingdom prospered and thrived crops were bountiful
querying upasena and a summary

is told in sections on
he too called up the four branches of his armed forces
the elephant corps the cavalry the charioteer corps and the infantryand laid waste to all of anga save campa before returning
at yet another time when the king of anga and his armies were dominant
then he said to his ministers
head in hands he sat and sat absorbed in thought
king mahapadma was unsettled by the message he heard
flee to the mountaintops and even there you shall find no escape
tunnel beneath the earth and i will yank you up as if with a hook
if you do not surrender and instead take flight into the sky above i will fell you with a volley of arrows
it would be good were you to come out
the king of anga sent an envoy to king mahapadma with the message
entering rajagrha he closed the gates and shut himself up within the walls of his fortress
defeated and frightened destroyed and conquered king mahapadma retreated
the king of anga captured king mahapadmas entire elephant corps
and proceeded to capture the whole of his cavalry charioteer corps and infantry
and rode out to meet the king of anga in battle
when king mahapadma heard this he too called up the four branches of his armed forcesthe elephant corps the cavalry the charioteer corps and the infantry
they spoke in verse
when land and life are threatened
seek always to protect life
when the wise look at both
king mahapadma hung his sword from his neck in surrender and went out
where the king of anga imposed an annual tribute and tax upon him
while the blessed bodhisattva was dwelling in the abode of tusita
he saw five sights and thrice gave notice to the six classes of gods who revel in the desire realm
assuming an elephants appearance
he entered his mothers womb as the earth shook and this world
and all others too were bathed in a vast light more luminous than the glow of the gods of the thirtythree
in rajagrha the son of king mahapadma was born
in sravasti the son of king arada brahmadatta was born
at the same time as the blessed bodhisattva was born
sons were also born to four great kings in four great citystates
there are others who have been born here
so great was this miraculous manifestation it was as if the sun and moon shone in the gulf between worlds so great was its strength that darkness everywhere
even the pitchblack darkness of dark places dark from never knowing the light of the sun and moon was filled with a vast light
beings born in those places had never even seen so far as their outstretched hands yet by this light these beings saw one another and exclaimed you there there are others who have been born here
and his military might is great
ruthless
gentlemen this king of anga is belligerent
in ujjayini the son of king anantanemi was born
in kausambi the son of king satanika was born
when the blessed bodhisattva was born
the entire universe was bathed in a vast light more luminous than the glow of the gods of the thirtythree
so great was this miraculous manifestation it was as if the sun and moon shone in the gulf between worlds
beings born in those places had never even seen so far as their outstretched hands
yet by this light these beings saw one another and exclaimed you there there are others who have been born here
there are others who have been born here
king mahapadma thought
when my son was born the world was lit as if by the gold of the rising sun
and as he is the son of queen bimbi goldie
i shall name this prince bimbisara essence of gold
and so the boy was named bimbisara
king arada brahmadatta thought
when my son was born the world was lit as if by the light of lights
so i shall name this prince prasenajit supreme light
and so the boy was named prasenajit
king satanika thought
when my son was born the world was lit as if by the rising sun so i shall name this prince udayana rising
and so the boy was named udayana
king anantanemi thought
when my son was born the world was lit by a brilliant light so i shall name this prince pradyota brilliant light
and so the boy was named pradyota
and so each king attributed the light to the birth of his own son
so great was its strength that darkness everywhere even the pitchblack darkness of dark places dark from never knowing the light of the sun and moon was filled with a vast light
though each attributed it to his own son
it was not so
for all that occurred occurred because of the bodhisattva
on the very same day that prince bimbisara was born
five hundred sons of five hundred ministers were also born
and were given names appropriate to their patrilineage
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
these arts and skills were also mastered by the five hundred sons of the five hundred ministers
bimbisaras father enrolled him in the eighteen guilds due to which he was named and became known as bimbisara of the guilds
later prince bimbisara ventured into the countryside astride an elephant
where he saw the king of angas officers collecting tributes and taxes prompting him to inquire of his men
gentlemen for whom are these tributes and taxes being collected
what will we be offered tribute
when the officers were summoned he said
if i too have been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king
why is it you are collecting tributes and taxes here
gentlemen the king of anga has been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king
i forbid you to collect tributes and taxes from this day forth
gentlemen the prince doesnt understand the situation continue to collect tributes and taxes as you have done before
they went to king mahapadma and said
your majesty when we officers of the king of anga were collecting tributes and taxes
prince bimbisara stopped us from doing so
shall we collect them or not
the prince fails to appreciate the situation they thought let us go submit the matter to king mahapadma
they had begun their collection again
when prince bimbisara spotted them on their way back from the countryside and said
gentlemen have i not already prohibited you from collecting tributes and taxes
why are you collecting them again
you are to desist fail to desist and i shall close the borders
frightened they thought
the prince is dangerous and ruthless
in time he may pose a serious risk to us
we must go warn the king of anga
they went before the king of anga and said
your majesty as officers of the court
we were collecting tributes and taxes on your behalf when king mahapadmas son prince bimbisara stopped us
if your majesty ignores the princes actions
he may in time pose a serious risk to us
then they spoke in verse
when a tree is small fingernails may fell it
yet when the tree is large
even a hundred axes may fail
son we are tributaries
they have sent me a letter expressing their anger
son why did you stop the king of angas officers from collecting tributes and taxes
then he summoned prince bimbisara and said
he sat and sat absorbed in thought
king mahapadma heard this letter read and was troubled head in hands
the king of anga sent a letter to king mahapadma send prince bimbisara with his sword hung from his neck
or prepare your pyre and shroud for i myself will come
and we too have been crowned and anointed ksatriya kings
why do we offer tribute and taxes to him
give me an army of just four divisions your majesty
and i will meet the king of anga in battle
king mahapadma then sent a message to the king of anga saying you had best hope all the power forces will and authority you possess do not fail you
the king of anga found this message intolerable and commanded his ministers
gentlemen lay waste to those lands
call up the four branches of the armed forces
if he falls then all fall
as spokes at a hubs collapse
in whose house dwells glory
it is he we should protect
then they said in verse
gentlemen what if i were to meet the king of anga in battle what would you do
prince your struggle shall be our struggle they responded
prince bimbisara gathered the five hundred ministers sons and said
he summoned prince bimbisara and gave him charge over the four branches of the armed forces
king mahapadma was troubled by this news and head in hands sat and sat absorbed in thought
now you must do all you can to protect me
whatever your majestys plight may be that too shall be ours
wherever your majestys foot may fall there shall we bow our heads
the four branches of the armed forces were then called up
and they set out from rajagrha
when king mahapadma who sat shut up in his upper citadel surrounded by his council saw them depart he asked his ministers
gentlemen whose army is this
your majesty it is prince bimbisaras
gentlemen it is awesome to behold
hence the prince was named and became known as bimbisara of the army
some knew him as bimbisara of the guilds while some knew him as bimbisara of the army
prince bimbisara said to the five hundred sons of the ministers
gentlemen this king of anga is belligerent ruthless and his military might is great so we cannot meet him in battle
therefore we will sneak in overrun his exposed camp and kill him while their guard is down and their armor off
they overran the king of angas exposed camp while their guard was down and their armor off sneaking up and killing him
the four branches of the king of angas armed forces scattered to the four directions
prince bimbisara sent mounted emissaries in the four directions with the message
gentlemen you have been crowned and anointed kings of ksatriya
and i too have been crowned and anointed a ksatriya king so return
i for my part will assume the reins of power here
and so prince bimbisara assumed the reins of power under him the kingdom prospered and thrived crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people
once king mahapadmas time had come
the ministers of rajagrha sent a message to king bimbisara saying your majesty your fathers time has come
in a great coronation ceremony the ministers of rajagrha and magadha granted him sovereignty over the lands of anga and magadha
under king bimbisaras rule the kingdoms of anga and magadha prospered and thrived crops were bountiful and the land teemed with animals and people
seek always to protect life
when the wise look at both
they see land but not life can be found again
with that thought he hung his sword from his neck in surrender and came out
son you must take the reins of power there
your majesty tell me what else needs to be done and i shall see to it
pleased king mahapadma sent prince bimbisara a parasol a turban and a coronet with the message
your majesty i have slain the king of anga and campa is now in my hands
with the king of anga slain campa fell into prince bimbisaras hands at which point he sent a message to king mahapadma saying
when land and life are threatened
it distressed the steward of campa to hear this and he thought of this verse
it is i who has brought your lord to this state
come out immediately and i shall look favorably upon you
fail to appear and you too will soon find yourself in this state
when at last prince bimbisara reached campa
the prince fixed the king of angas head onto a long pole and displayed it saying
he rid the land of brigands thieves famine and illness and brought a wealth of rice sugar cane cattle and buffalo
devout the just king ruled justly
there was a young brahmin who desiring and in search of esoteric instruction left the middle country and went to the south
there in a land not his own lived a teacher of brahmins who had mastered the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
the young brahmin went to see this teacher of brahmins serene the young brahmin bowed his head calmly and sat off to one side
the brahmin teacher warmly greeted him with words of welcome and asked
young brahmin where have you come from and what do you desire
i hail from the middle country and i seek to serve at the feet of a master
why so that i may recite the vedas
excellent my son you should do just that
for that is a brahmins duty
and so the young brahmin began to recite the vedas with the teacher of brahmins
the brahmins students were in the habit
on the way they had the following conversation
to begin with let us share where we come from from which land we hail
one young brahmin responded
i am from the east
once when not occupied with their studies they went to collect wood for fire pujas
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
he completely pacified conflict aggressors and enemies from without as well as disturbances from within
said another
i am from the south
i am from the west
i am from the north
the young brahmin then said
i am from the middle country
to him they said
sir we have seen and heard of all those other countries
but have neither seen nor heard of the middle country
in the east they are wise
in the south they are cunning
in the west they stir division
in the north they speak roughly
and then they added this verse
young brahmin they asked what is the middle country like
gentlemen the middle country is the best of all lands
abounding in rice sugar cane cattle and buffalo
at one point where sages are known to gather the river flows through eighteen bends
there sages seek to bodily rise to the heavens through their practice of austerities
young brahmin having met you we have another question
do you have men counted as learned in the middle country
young brahmin you did say that
thronging with hundreds of honest women and filled with upstanding men devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
the river ganga bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shores
young brahmin are there any in the middle country like our master the wisest of philosophers
gentlemen in the middle country the philosophers are such that our teacher could not even look them in the face
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
on hearing the young brahmin speak so highly of the middle country
they were moved by the desire to visit it
the young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pujas
bearing their loads of wood they came to the house in which the teacher of brahmins lived
on arriving they set their loads of wood off to one side
went to him and said
master please listen
the young brahmin from the middle country speaks so highly of it that we are moved by the desire to visit
the brahmin said
boys would you visit every place of which you hear
my sons do i say i am the one and only philosopher on this earth
that there are no other philosophers
after all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after another
along the way he defeated an opponent in debate and then bound him to his chariot
he poured ashes from a pot on anothers head
another steered clear of him like a crow does an archery range
another received him with parasols victory banners and standards
the brahmin thought
why bother pulling off the branches petals and leaves while leaving the root
since all worthy opponents and anyone counted as learned will be close to the king
it is the king i shall see
with that the brahmin went to see king bimbisara
on arriving he wished king bimbisara success and long life
took a place off to one side and addressed him
your majesty from my guru i have received a few teachings
and so i seek to settle a matter in debate with an opponent in your majestys presence
the king asked his ministers
gentlemen are there any opponents in my kingdom capable of settling a matter in debate with this brahmin
he has put together a work known as matharas treatise
summon master mathara
as you wish your majesty
mathara received the summons and went to see king bimbisara
on arrival he wished king bimbisara success and long life then took a place off to one side
with blazing intelligence this capable man illuminates his own assertions and smashes those of others
your majesty in the village of nalada there is a brahmin known as mathara
who has mastered the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
having collected their things the brahmin set off with the young brahmins for the middle country
in that case my sons let us gather our funds robes walking staffs ladles funnels and washing bowls and go to the middle country
as the brahmin was attached to his students and his circle of students was small he said to the young brahmins
we will go to the middle country
we will make a name for ourselves and find our fortune too
we will defeat opponents
we will serve the wisest of philosophers
we will see that country yet master if only for a short while we will bathe on the banks of the river
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
master according to this young brahmin in the middle country the philosophers are such that you our teacher could not even look them in the face
since you seem to derive so much pleasure from hearing of other countries i would suggest you not visit those places you hear about
the ministers said
this is the master your majesty
the king greeted him with words of welcome and asked
master can you settle a matter in debate in my presence with this brahmin
replied mathara
i as a capable man shall do as the king pleases
the king ordered the ministers
gentlemen prepare the debate arena
and assign the disputants their roles
the ministers prepared the debate arena and assigned the disputants their roles
the ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and asked
your majesty who would you have defend a position first
this brahmin is a visitor so have him defend a position first
having been assigned to defend a position first the brahmin proceeded to recite five hundred stanzas
mathara repeated them and then said
this position of yours is devoid of logic
it is inconsistent and incoherent
the brahmin remained silent as mathara pointed out the positions faults
that the brahmin had no confidence to respond was damning and among the reasons he was vanquished
the king asked the ministers
gentlemen who won
mathara your majesty
this pleased the king who straightened up extended his right arm
it is a fine discovery for me to find this wisest of philosophers in my kingdom
master where do you live
your majesty in nalada
go and let that village be your victors prize
mathara was thrilled delighted and overjoyed
surrounded by learned men
he returned to his village
and since the world desires success and distrusts failure several brahmins pressed their daughters on him in marriage
mathara then took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all their desires
the wife with whom he sported made love and indulged all desires gave birth to a son with an extraordinarily long torso
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style
during which time they chose a name for the boy
the relatives said
since this boy has an extraordinarily long torso he should be named kosthila long torso
the young brahmin was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle him
two to breastfeed him
two to change his diapers
and two to play with him
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
when he was old enough he was introduced to letters
he was instructed in the ways of brahmins
number names calculation counting by hand how to exclude to add and to leave and to parse until he had mastered reading
their conduct ritual purity and observances the handling of ashes the handling of ritual vases and the handling of sites
hand gestures turbans offering praise and salutations
the rgveda the yajurveda the samaveda and the atharvaveda
and a brahmins six duties
making ritual sacrifices officiating over ritual sacrifices studying teaching giving and receiving
he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions
and vanquish those of others
her father taught her how to combine letters into words so she became proficient in reading
later when the young brahmin kosthila was debating sarika sarika vanquished him
and their father said to kosthila
son if you are a male how has a female vanquished you
once im gone the spoils ive won in debate will be taken away
at that the young brahmin kosthila desiring and in search of esoteric instruction set off from the middle country for the south
there in a country not his own lived a brahmin named tisya who was learned in lokayata philosophy
a teacher of brahmins and a master of the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
kosthila went to see the brahmin tisya
serene the young brahmin kosthila bowed at tisyas feet and sat off to one side
tisya warmly greeted kosthila with words of welcome asking
young brahmin where have you come from and what do you desire
i hail from the middle country
and i seek to serve at the feet of the master
why
so that i may uphold the lokayata philosophy
and so the young brahmin kosthila began to study lokayata philosophy in the presence of the brahmin tisya
the girl sarika was nurtured and grew
the relatives said
since this girl has eyes like a sari this girl should be given the name sarika
during which time they chose a name for the girl
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate her birth in grand style
the wife with whom mathara sported made love and indulged all desires again gave birth this time to a girl with eyes like a sari bird
the brahmins students were in the habit
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
visiting the city or collecting wood for use in fire pujas
once when not occupied with their studies they went to collect wood for fire pujas
i am from the east
one young brahmin responded
said another
i am from the south
i am from the west
i am from the north
the young brahmin then said
i am from the middle country
sir we have seen and heard of all those other countries but have neither seen nor heard of the middle country

the river ganga bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shores
at one point where sages are known to gather the river flows through eighteen bends
there sages seek to bodily rise to the heavens through their practice of austerities
young brahmin having met you we have another question
do you have men counted as learned in the middle country
gentlemen from the first did i not say gentlemen the middle country is filled with upstanding men
devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
young brahmin you did say that
young brahmin are there any in the middle country like our master the wisest of philosophers
on hearing the young brahmin speak so highly of the middle country
they were moved by the desire to visit it
the young brahmins then went off to collect wood for use in fire pujas

on arriving they set their loads of wood off to one side went to him and said

the brahmin tisya said
boys would you visit every place of which you hear
after all since the earth contains many gems its surface is covered with one beauty after another
my sons do i say i am the one and only philosopher on this earth that there are no other philosophers
master according to this young brahmin in the middle country the philosophers are such that you our teacher could not even look them in the face
since you seem to derive so much pleasure from hearing of other countries i would suggest you not visit those places you hear about
gentlemen in the middle country the philosophers are such that our teacher could not even look them in the face so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
so eloquently do they speak so wise are they
we will serve the wisest of philosophers
we will see that country yet master if only for a short while
we will bathe on the banks of the river
we will defeat opponents
we will make a name for ourselves and find our fortune too
we will go to the middle country
as the brahmin was attached to his students
and his circle of students was small he said to the young brahmins
in that case my sons let us gather our funds robes walking staffs ladles funnels and washing bowls and go to the middle country
having collected their things the brahmin set off with the young brahmins for the middle country
along the way he defeated an opponent in debate and then bound him to his chariot
he poured ashes from a pot on anothers head
another steered clear of him like a crow does an archery range
another received him with parasols victory banners and standards
another made a pledge to become his student
as he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached rajagrha
the brahmin tisya thought
why bother pulling off the branches petals and leaves while leaving the root
on arriving he wished the king success and long life
took a place off to one side and addressed him
your majesty from my guru i have received a few teachings
in time the brahmin tisya went to see king bimbisara
it is the king i shall see
since all worthy opponents and anyone counted as learned will be close to the king
and so i seek to settle a matter in debate with an opponent in your majestys presence
summon master mathara
the king asked the ministers gentlemen where is master mathara in nalada your majesty
as you wish your majesty on receiving the summons mathara went to see king bimbisara
on arrival he wished the king success and long life then took a place off to one side
the ministers said
this is the master your majesty
the king greeted him with words of welcome and asked
master can you settle a matter in debate in my presence with this brahmin tisya
replied mathara
i as a capable man shall do as the king pleases
the brahmin tisya repeated them and
this position of yours is devoid of logic
it is inconsistent and incoherent
the other brahmin remained silent as tisya pointed out the texts faults
i shall focus on an old text and with that he recited five hundred stanzas
this brahmin tisya is clearly acquainted with new treatises so i cannot debate him on them
the brahmin mathara thought
as the brahmin mathara is the elder i ask that you have him defend a position first
said he brahmin tisya
the brahmin tisya is a visitor so have him defend a position first
the ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and asked
the ministers prepared the debate arena and assigned the disputants their roles
the king ordered the ministers
gentlemen prepare the debate arena and assign the disputants their roles
that mathara had no confidence to respond was damning and among the reasons he was vanquished
the king asked the ministers
gentlemen who won
the brahmin tisya your majesty
gentlemen give the brahmin tisya a victors prize
therefore make the village of nalada the standard victors prize
take it from the brahmin mathara
and give it to this brahmin
and if any other should best tisya then award it to the victor
the village was then taken from the brahmin mathara and given to the brahmin tisya
the brahmin mathara thought
though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i shall go elsewhere he said to his wife
noble lady though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i shall go elsewhere so pack up our household
with that they began packing up their household
when their relatives heard that the master mathara was leaving
they went to see him and asked
master why are you packing up your household
gentlemen though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
therefore i shall go elsewhere
mathara replied in verse
better to live in anothers land than to be oppressed in ones own
there where a man lives free is the place he finds his home and friends
master do not leave for other parts remain for a while at your leisure in the home of your relatives
if you give a prize to everyone who wins a debate before long your lands of anga and magadha will themselves be victors prizes
they replied
gentlemen said the king that is what i shall do
when the brahmin tisya heard that the master mathara was to leave
he went to him and said
i have come only for a short time and before long am certain to go
let this remain your victors prize
do not leave you must stay
mathara replied i intend to leave young brahmin
mathara thought
though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
i will give sarika to him as a wife mathara then said to his wife
noble lady though i have done much for this king he has not taken care of me
why would you give sarika to him in marriage
his parents said
anyone else in our position would try to take his life if he has robbed us so
hasnt he robbed us of our livelihood
father mother how could i accept this enemy into our family
i shall give sarika to him as a wife kosthila replied
son though we have done much for this king he has not taken care of us
his parents summoned kosthila and said
call our son kosthila
master if that is how you feel you should keep half of this village and i shall keep claim to the other half
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement i shall give sarika to him as a wife
yet out of consideration for me this brahmin tisya has offered to share our prizea most beneficial arrangement
fool what do you know
ignoring what he said they gave sarika to the brahmin tisya as a wife
in a lavish ceremony tisya took sarika as his bride
the young brahmin kosthila thought
this insult is all due to my lack of learning
he thought what does the brahmin tisya know
he knows lokayata philosophy he asked around
gentlemen where is the lokayata philosophy known
in the south
gentlemen who knows the lokayata philosophy
on arrival he inquired
he was told he set out on the journey for the south to learn lokayata philosophy
the wanderers
he went to them and said
i seek to serve you gentlemen
why so that i may grasp the lokayata philosophy
in that case i shall go forth
so he let his fingernails grow extraordinarily long
and for this he became known as the wanderer dirghanakha he who has long fingernails
when sarika challenged her husband tisya he vanquished her
later as tisya and sarika sported made love
and indulged all their desires a sentient being in search of his final rebirth
who had grasped the essence of liberation
who had turned to nirvana and away from samsara
who had seen that all births end in death who did not seek to be reborn
and who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered sarikas womb
we do not teach lokayata philosophy to householders
sarika dreamed that a man carrying a torch rent and entered her belly she climbed to a mountain peak
she moved through the sky above an assembly of great men prostrated to her
she then told tisya about her dream
though tisya was expert at interpreting dreams and omens
he consulted other brahmins who interpreted them
what does it portend he asked
after his birth sarika said to tisya
if we present this brahmin boy to his grandfather he will give him a name
after eight or nine months
with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasol long arms a broad forehead
eyebrows that met and a prominent nose
a boy was born
he thought it is because of the being who has entered her womb
the next time tisya and sarika engaged in debate sarika vanquished him
making him wonder if i have vanquished her in the past what now has allowed her to vanquish me
an assembly of great men prostrated to me these statements indicate her son will go forth and become a great saint who perfects his vow
i climbed to a mountain peak i moved through the sky above
it portends that after twice eight years he will have studied the aindra school of grammar and will vanquish all opponents
her statement a man carrying a torch rent and entered my belly indicates a son will be born
they replied master that is an excellent portent
if my brahmin wife has had such a dream
and with his blazing intelligence he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others
his father made him study all fields of knowledge
at another time when he was reciting the vedas with his father he asked
father what is the meaning of this statement
son even i do not know the meaning of this statement
and thus by the age of sixteen he had studied the aindra school of grammar and could vanquish all opponents
but these rudiments of mantra have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages
nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them
tisya was delighted and in his delight thought
this is what a son should do
he should carry on his fathers tradition or
develop his insight even further
when the young brahmin upatisya taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite brahminic mantras
he summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
explaining their meaning and etymologies
he shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahminic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to upatisya
were he to accomplish only this this brahmin boys insight would surpass my own
this is what such statements mean
father do you think there is no meaning to these rudiments of mantra which have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins
in the village of kasthavata
there lived a royal priest named potalaka who was wealthy with many riches and goods
he took a wife of equal caste
and with her sported
made love and indulged all his desires
after their sporting lovemaking
and the indulgence of all their desires resulted in no child male or female
the childless couple badly wanting a child propitiated siva varuna kubera sakra brahma and others
among the different gods were gods of park shrines gods of the forest
gods of crossroads
gods of intersections
gods who take votive offerings
there is a saying boys and girls are born in the world because they are prayed for
but that is not so for if it were then each and every man would have a thousand sons as do the kings of the world
rather boys and girls are born when three circumstances are present
what are those three
the mother and father feel desire and couple
it is the right time and the mother is ovulating
and a spirit is near and wants to be reborn
and so it is that boys and girls are born when those three circumstances are present
certain women endowed with natural intelligence have five unique qualities
and who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered his wifes womb
who had seen that all births end in death who did not seek to be reborn
who had turned to nirvana and away from samsara
a being in search of his final rebirth who had grasped the essence of liberation
as potalaka sat engrossed in prayer
with holdings both vast and extensive with riches to rival vaisravana
what are the five
they know when a man feels desire and when he does not
they know when the time comes
and when they are ovulating
if it is a boy he lies with his head to the right side of the womb
if it is a girl she lies with her head to the left side of the womb
they know when they have conceived they know whence the conceived child came
and they know whether it is a boy or a girl
delighted potalakas wife joyfully told her husband
at last i shall look on the face of the son i have wanted for so long
may we get along and not disagree
may he carry on my work and
having been nurtured nurture in return
may he enjoy his inheritance and ensure that my line lasts long
on the doctors advice her food was not to be too bitter too sour
too salty too sweet
too spicy or too astringent
and so she was given food that was not bitter sour salty sweet spicy or astringent
her body was festooned in garlands necklaces and jewelry like a goddess at play in a pleasure garden
when it was hot she was given what she needed for the heat
she moved from bed to throne
from the time the sun rises to the time it sets there shall be no challenger to equal you
vinayavastu
dulwa shi
when our time comes and we die may he make the appropriate offerings neither too few nor too many
and may he dedicate the merit he thus accrues to us by name saying may this merit follow the two of them wherever they be born wherever they go
knowing she was with child to ensure she carried the child to term he installed his wife on the top story of their mansion where he saw that she was tended to and did not come to harm when it was cold she was given what she needed for the cold
son of a lord i am with child
from pedestal to pedestal the soles of her feet never touching the floor
and she never heard anything even slightly unpleasant
after eight or nine months had passed a boy was born well proportioned pleasing to the eye handsome radiant with a golden complexion a head shaped well like a parasol long arms a broad forehead eyebrows that met and a prominent nose
three weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand style during which time they chose a name for the boy
as this boy had come to them from the lap of the gods
they thought the young brahmin should be named kolita born from the lap
and so he was named kolita
also because he was a descendent of mudgala they thought the young brahmin should be named maudgalyayana son of mudgalas descendants
and so he was named maudgalyayana
thus it was that some knew the young brahmin as maudgalyayana
while others knew him as kolita
the young brahmin kolita was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle him
two to breastfeed him
two to change his diapers
and two to play with him
fortified with milk curd butter ghee cream and other nourishing foods
he grew quickly shooting up like a lotus in a pond
when he was old enough he was introduced to letters
number names calculation counting by hand and how to exclude
to add to leave and to parse
once he had mastered letters
he was instructed in the ways of brahmins
their conduct ritual purity and observances
the handling of ashes
the handling of ritual vases
and the handling of sites
hand gestures
turbans
offering praise
and salutations
the rgveda
the yajurveda
the samaveda
and the atharvaveda
and a brahmins six dutiesmaking ritual sacrifices
officiating over ritual sacrifices
studying
teaching
giving
and receiving
he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
and with his blazing intelligence
he could illuminate his own assertions and vanquish those of others
his father made him study all fields of knowledge
once when he was reciting the vedas with his father he asked
father what does this statement mean
son even i dont know the meaning of this statement
sages of the past praised proclaimed and correctly applied these rudiments of mantra
but nowadays brahmins simply recite and repeat them
potalaka was delighted and in his delight thought
this is what a son should do
the young brahmin maudgalyayana then taught the five hundred young brahmins to recite the brahminic mantras
the five hundred young brahmins were in the habit
he should carry on his fathers tradition or develop his insight even further were he to accomplish only that
this brahmin boys insight would surpass my own
potalaka shared this insight with the five hundred young brahmins he was teaching to recite brahminic mantras and they too were delighted and happily turned to maudgalyayana
this is what such statements mean and he proceeded to explain
father do you think there is no meaning to these rudiments of mantra which have been praised proclaimed and correctly applied by past sages but nowadays are simply recited and repeated by brahmins
when not occupied with their studies of going to the riverbank to bathe
visiting the city
or collecting wood for use in fire pujas
once when not occupied with their studies
the students of the young brahmin upatisya walked reciting mantras on their way to the city
meanwhile trailing behind the students of the young brahmin maudgalyayana walked reciting mantras on their way to the city
when the students of the young brahmin maudgalyayana heard the students of the young brahmin upatisya reciting the rudiments of mantra they asked
why do you recite the rudiments of mantra in such a debased way
the rudiments of mantra should be recited as we do
in the village of nalada lives the brahmin tisya
we have learned them from his son the young brahmin upatisya
and from whom did you learn these rudiments of mantra
in the village of kasthavata there lives a royal priest named potalaka
we have learned them from his son the young brahmin kolita
with that the young brahmin students of upatisya became dispirited upset and daunted
from whom did you learn these rudiments of mantra
they went to upatisya who saw them off in the distance and asked
what troubles you young brahmins
your master is never wrong
then he spoke in verse
after they explained the situation at length upatisya said
on hearing of the other both kolita and upatisya formed a singular desire to meet the other upatisya went to his father and said
he too then spoke the verse
those things you feel from within are clearly seen from without
they went to kolita who too on seeing them off in the distance asked
you cannot mask your voice your complexion or your mien
young brahmins clearly something troubles you
after they explained the situation at length he said
young brahmins allow me to explain
although the rudiments of mantra should be recited in the manner we have recited them
that young brahmin upatisya is wise for he has he summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
although the rudiments of mantra should be recited in the manner those young brahmins recite them
i have summarized the longer vedas abridging their words and phrases and expanded on the shorter vedas
explaining their meaning and etymologies the students of kolita had also become dispirited upset and daunted
father i wish to visit the village of kasthavata
son go and join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka
a short time later a small task came up prompting king bimbisara to say to prince ajatasatru
some time later in rajagrha the feast day of the naga kings giri and valguka approached
as the day neared king bimbisara wondered whether he should join in the festivities himself as was his wont or send prince ajatasatru in his stead
son is he wealthier than you
father he is not wealthier than i
it is rather that he is wiser
father i wish to visit the village of nalada for there lives a brahmin tisya whose son is called upatisya i shall go to see him
kolita also went to his father and said
for there lives a royal priest named potalaka whose son is called kolita i shall go to see him
son is he wiser than you father he is not wiser than i it is rather that he is wealthier
when the brahmin potalaka heard that king bimbisara had sent prince ajatasatru to join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka he thought
prince ajatasatru will become king once his father dies and kolita will become royal priest when i die
when the music began the dancers sang in totaka meter
when upatisya arrived he passed the kings and the royal priests seats placed a small stick and vase on the seat for the reigning champion and sat down on the challengers seat
when the brahmin tisya heard that king bimbisara had sent prince ajatasatru to join in the festivities for the naga kings giri and valguka he too said to upatisya
thus their acquaintance will in time bear fruit he said to kolita
on arriving he left the kings seat be and sat on the royal priests seat
the people began to dance and sing
while the two young brahmins sat in repose
when the assembled crowd saw this they exclaimed
as the music wound down and the people went off dancing and singing
kolita asked upatisya
either those two young brahmins are fools or theyre unflappable
upatisya said to kolita
come join me as we have faith in only what is perfect let us go forth from home into homelessness
and all bodies but impermanent
all songs nonsense
all dance a competition
kolita replied in verse
all adornment is a weight
upatisya replied in verse
what wise man would not be vigilant
people know me thus
upatisya recited a verse
when a tree rots
what use has it for blossoms and boughs
when a person dies
what use has he for possessions
the young brahmin kolita went to his parents and said
father mother please listen
as i have faith in only what is perfect i shall go forth from home into homelessness
son the royal priesthood for which you have made offerings to the gods performed fire puja
and suffered through austerities is within reach having been born into a caste borne about by elephants why would you renounce it
kolita spoke in verse
to live in the forest clad in bark or grass eating roots and fruit among beasts is best
fearing the future
the wise refuse to kill imprison or torture for temporal power
his parents replied
son you are our only boy beloved handsome patient and agreeable to the eye
even if you were to die we would fight to keep you with us
why then do you think wed let you go while youre still alive
father mother it is best you let me go
for if you do not from this day forth i shall neither eat your food nor honor you
dear boy we will not let you leave so long as we live you will remain within sight do not think of disobeying
housing disputes and schisms in the sangha
the whole of the chapter on going forth

he whom the king of anga left to defend the city of campa

sons of kutsa sons of vatsa sons of sandili sons of bharadvaja sons of the five sons of the further five
gentlemen from the first did i not say gentlemen the middle country is filled with upstanding men devoid of foreign savages and guided by learned men
another made a pledge to become his student as he went he vanquished one opponent after another in villages cities towns marketplaces and hamlets until he reached rajagrha
he saluted mathara and asked
excellent my son you should do just that for that is a brahmins duty
on the way they had the following conversation
sons of kutsa sons of vatsa sons of sandili sons of bharadvaja sons of the five sons of the further five to begin with let us share where we come from from which land we hail

after they allowed his going forth he said

giving and receiving he mastered and became learned in the vedas and all branches of vedic knowledge
and he proceeded to explain
birth totem gods gods who adhere to the dharma and gods who always shadow you
and as it lies with its head to the right side of my womb it is sure to be a boy so pray be happy
potalaka too was delighted he sat straight up raised his right hand and exclaimed with great joy
how should they be recited
not to know him is not to know the sun or the moon
what troubles you young brahmins your master is never wrong
explaining their meaning and etymologies
some are greater due to pedigree others because of age or riches
but they all seek to sit at the doorstep of the learned
son if he should come here you should share your learning but you mustnt go to him
some are greater due to pedigree
others because of age or learning
but they all sit subservient at the doorstep of the rich

leave the kings seat be and take your place in the royal priests seat
leave the kings seat and the royal priests seat be but place a small stick and vase on the reigning champions seat before sitting down on the challengers seat
did it seem to you that the dances were well danced the songs well sung and the music well played
it seemed so to those who saw and heard them
if it is true that those who withdraw into repose do not see how then do they not hear
in a crowd of people destined for death who laugh and flirt though their dead skin and dead flesh will die
are you upatisya
are you kolita
come join me as we have faith in only what is perfect let us go forth from home into homelessness
i must first consult my parents
dear boy we will not let you leave so long as we live you will remain within sight do not think of disobeying
kolita refused food for one day
then for a second and for a third until the sixth day
at that point kolitas parents went to him and said dear boy please listen
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
it is hard to live the holy life
it is hard to live in solitude it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
dear boy kolita come home there is pleasure to be had while living here too
here too you may give generously here too you may act meritoriously
despite their pleading kolita remained silent
kolitas parents again entreated him a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen
dear boy kolita come home there is pleasure to be had while living here too
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
it is hard to live in solitude it is hard to be happy all on your own
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
here too you may give generously here too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him a second and a third time kolita remained silent
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and dont know what it is to suffer it is hard to live the holy life
dear boy please listen
at this kolitas relatives went to him and said
family come talk sense into our dear boy kolita
kolitas parents then enjoined his relatives
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
despite their pleading kolita did not say a thing
kolitas relatives again entreated him a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
it is hard to live the holy life it is hard to live in solitude
it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures

dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus pleaded with him a second time and a third time kolita still remained silent
kolitas parents then enjoined his childhood friends you must come
you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and do not know what it is to suffer
dear boy listen
at this the young brahmin kolitas childhood friends went to him and said
talk sense into our dear boy kolita
it is hard to live the holy life it is hard to live in solitude
it is hard to be happy all on your own
it is hard to make your bed in distant forests at the foot of mountains and in remote places
living alone in the wilderness is very trying
you will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animals
you will have to spend the rest of your life living on others handouts
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
you will have to spend the rest of your life away from the fun and games of ordinary people
dear boy kolita come home there is also pleasure to be had while living among your relatives
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him kolita remained silent
his childhood friends again entreated kolita a second and a third time saying each time
dear boy please listen you are very young and have lived a life of leisure and you do not know what it is to suffer
dear boy kolita come home among your relatives there is pleasure to be had while living there too
there too you may give generously there too you may act meritoriously
yet though they thus entreated him a second and a third time kolita still remained silent
kolitas childhood friends then went to his parents and said
father mother please listen
what good can come from the death of the serene youth kolita
the wise have praised going forth so if going forth makes him happy then at least you will see him alive
if he isnt happy he can always give up the life of a sage
and since he will have no home but yours it is better that you let him go forth
kolitas parents then asked kolita
dear boy kolita do you think it better to go forth than to remain at home
father mother it is not good for me to live at home it is good for me to go forth
well then dear boy kolita know that the time for such a change has come
having obtained his parents consent the young brahmin kolita slowly regained his strength vigor and determination by drinking rice gruel
he left the village of kasthavata and set out for the village of nalada
as the young brahmin upatisya enjoyed solitude he had gone to live in the forest
where he gave instruction to five hundred young brahmins in the reciting of mantras
in time the young brahmin kolita reached the village of nalada and asked upatisyas parents
father mother where is upatisya
father mother where is upatisya
they replied upatisya enjoys solitude so he has gone to live in the forest
where he instructs five hundred young brahmins in the reciting of mantras
kolita went to upatisya and said
come join me upatisya as we have faith in only what is perfect we shall go forth from home into the homelessness
did your parents give their consent
they did
young brahmin please stay until i have asked my parents
upatisya went to his parents and said
young brahmin i will see that they give their consent right away and return
upatisya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent how long will it be until you have consent
father mother please listen
as i have faith in only what is perfect i shall go forth from home into homelessness
son is it good for you to go forth
father mother it is good for me to go forth
then go forth son
upatisya went to kolita and said
come kolita as we have faith in only what is perfect we shall go forth from home into homelessness
while i was hindered by light bindings powerless weak and perishable
you were hindered by heavy bindings tight secure and imperishable
upatisya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent how did you get the consent of yours so quickly
the venerable sariputra had gone forth in five hundred previous lives because he had made this prayer
may i be born not in a wealthy house nor in one that is poor let it be rather in a house of moderate means and always among many renunciants
kolita said to upatisya
young brahmin as we are wellknown brahmins we cannot join just any renunciant order
meanwhile there were six tirthika teachers living in rajagrha who entertained the conceit of omniscience although they were not omniscient
we must properly scrutinize the different renunciant orders and only then join one with that they made their way to rajagrha
purana kasyapa gosaliputra the wanderer sanjayin son of vairatti ajita of the hair shawl
kakuda a descendant of katyayana and jnatiputra the nirgrantha
the young brahmins upatisya and kolita went to purana kasyapa and asked him
sir what is your approach to the dharma
what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living a holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied purana this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
there is nothing to alms oblations ritual sacrifices good deeds or bad deeds
there are no results or fruitions from performing good deeds or bad deeds
there is no present life there is no afterlife
there is no mother there is no father
sentient beings are not born miraculously
in the world there are no arhats who have reached perfection who have entered perfection
who can knowingly say that through their heightened insight they have seen this and future lives and proclaim we have overcome birth
we have lived the holy life we have done what needed to be done
we will know no life other than this
ones lifeforce persists for the duration of this life but is annihilated after that
it will perish and after death will not arise again
a persons body is forged from the four great elements
for once its time is up the bodys solid structures recede into earth
the bodys fluids recede into water the bodys heat recedes into fire and the bodys vital energies recede into wind
the senses fade into space
a persons corpse is borne on a bier carried by four men and taken to the charnel ground where it is burned never to be seen again
what burns turns to ash the bones turn a pigeonlike grey
those who are confused about these things counsel giving while the wise counsel taking
those who argue that such things exist are all vainly debating what is empty and hollow
both the childish and the wise will cease to be
the young brahmins upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher has strayed onto a spurious path
he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected
knowing this they spoke in verse he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
puranas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to gosaliputra the wanderer and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied the wanderer this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
that sentient beings are afflicted has nothing to do with causes and conditions
the affliction of sentient beings has nothing to do with causes and conditions
that sentient beings are purified has nothing to do with causes and conditions
the purification of sentient beings occurs randomly and by chance
that sentient beings lack understanding and insight has nothing to do with causes and conditions
their lack of understanding and insight occurs randomly and by chance
that sentient beings acquire understanding and insight has nothing to do with causes and conditions
their acquisition of understanding and insight occurs randomly and by chance
it is not due to vigor it is not due to determination it is not due to a combination of vigor and determination
it is not due to a persons skill it is not due to his overpowering ability
all beings all living things and all elements are powerless
it is not due to ones own skill it is not due to anothers skill
it is not due to a combination of ones own skill and anothers skill
it is not due to a combination of a persons skill and overpowering ability
they lack strength influence determination and the ability to overcome
a beings life is predetermined
that is why we experience the unique pleasures and pains of each of the six realms
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path
he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected
knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
gosaliputras teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to sanjayin son of vairatti and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied sanjayin this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
a person may act or make another person act
maim or make another person maim
burn or make another person burn flog or make another person flog
endanger life take what has not been given
engage wrongfully in acts of desire knowingly speak falsehoods
imbibe intoxicating drinks break into a house
pick a lock rob at knifepoint
block a road and lie in wait sack a town
sack a city sack a region
or slaughter dismember flog and tear apart every last being on this earth with the edge of a cakra blade
and having done all those things there would be no sin in that nor would any sin come from it
and then having cut up dismembered flogged and torn apart all beings
lay all the flesh out on a single plane in a single mound in a single pile or a single heap
n having laid all the flesh out on a single plane in a single mound in a single pile or a single heap
one could walk along the south bank of the river ganga and slaughter
dismember flog and tear apart everything
or walk along the north bank of the river ganga and give alms and oblations
and there would be no sin or merit in either
nor would sin or merit come from either
even if one practices generosity discipline perfect restraint
and acts with purpose and integrity one still does not gain merit
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
sanjayins teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to ajita of the hair shawl and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied ajita this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
seven bodies are not products they are not byproducts they are not apparitions they are not byproducts of apparitions
they are not subject to harm they are everlasting and they are still and solid like a pillar
what are the seven
the seven are thus the body of earth the body of water the body of fire the body of wind pleasure pain and the vitality of life
those seven bodies are not products are not byproducts
are not apparitions are not byproducts of apparitions are not subject to harm
are everlasting and are still and solid like a pillar
nor do they become merit nor do they become sin nor do they become both merit and sin
those seven are such
that they do not waver
nor do they become pleasure nor do they become pain nor do they become both pleasure and pain
they do not change nor do they harm one another
were one person to cut off the head of another person even that would not influence the world
nor would it cause the slightest harm to that which is still and solid
for the weapon would pass straight through the unbroken spaces in those seven bodies leaving the life within them unharmed
no rousing them no making to rouse them
no awareness of them no making to be aware of them
no knowing them and no making them known
sixtytwo paths sixtytwo intermediate eons
two types of actions action halfactions
five types of actions three types of actions
there is absolutely no killing them no making to kill them
in the meantime you are reborn in and cycle through principal places of rebirth great eons
thirtysix hells one hundred and twenty senses
sixtytwo constituent particles classes of naga families
classes of garuda classes of wanderers
classes of garuda classes of wanderers
classes of ajivika classes of nirgrantha
seven realms with discerning awareness seven realms lacking discerning awareness
seven nirgrantha realms seven demigod realms seven demonic realms
seven godly realms seven human realms seven great oceans
seven hundred lakes seven great dreams seven hundred dreams
seven states of great diminishment seven hundred states of diminishment
seven states of great increase seven hundred states of increase
seven states of great depletion seven hundred states of depletion
seven great abysses seven hundred abysses
six noble clans ten highstatus rebirths and the eight grounds of a great person
thus just as a ball of thread thrown in the air unravels into a long thread as it falls everyone be they childish or wise is liberated from suffering after having been through the cycle of rebirth for eons
no ascetic or brahmin can say
by observing ethics a vow asceticism or celibacy
i shall bring to fruition those acts that have not borne fruit and in facing those acts that have borne fruit purify them
our pleasures and pains are predestined it is impossible to extend or reduce them
as this is how things are and not otherwise the rounds of existence are thus to be counted
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied kakuda katyayana this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
if someone comes to me and asks is there an afterlife
i answer him by saying there is an afterlife
if he should ask is there not an afterlife
i answer him by saying there is no afterlife
if he should ask is there or is there not an afterlife
i answer him by saying there is and is not an afterlife
if he should ask does an afterlife neither exist nor not exist
i answer him by saying an afterlife neither exists nor does it not exist
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
ajitas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to kakuda katyayana and asked
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
likewise if someone comes to me and asks is the afterlife like or unlike this world
i answer him by saying the afterlife is like and unlike this world
if he should ask is the afterlife different or not different
i answer by saying the afterlife is different and not different if he should ask is the afterlife not different or not not different
if he should ask is the afterlife not different or not not different
i answer him by saying the afterlife is not different and not not different
if he should ask is the afterlife like that or not like that
i answer him by saying the afterlife is like that and not like that
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
kakuda katyayanas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
upatisya and kolita then went to jnatiputra the nirgrantha and asked
sir what is your approach to the dharma what instructions do you give to your students
what is the result of living the holy life what are its benefits
young brahmins replied the nirgrantha this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
no matter what a person individually experiences it all comes from causes sown in the past
old actions are purified through penance while new actions are averted by the dam of inactivity
in this way one avoids future defilement in the absence of defilement actions are exhausted
when actions are exhausted suffering is exhausted
when suffering is exhausted one is freed from suffering
upatisya and kolita thought
this noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path he pursues fully a ruinous path
this is exactly the kind of dangerous path the wise say must be rejected knowing this they spoke in verse
he who teaches a wrong and ruinous path is known to be an inferior teacher
if this is his dharma what for him is antithetical to dharma
the nirgranthas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved on
not long before word had spread about a tirthika named sanjayin
the young brahmins upatisya and kolita went to where the teacher sanjayin lived and asked
gentlemen where is the teacher sanjayin
he has withdrawn into seclusion
oh this is the first time weve heard the phrase withdrawn into seclusion in such a long time
they thought
it would not be right to disturb the teachers withdrawal into seclusion
we will approach him once he has risen from this state and with that they sat off to one side
the teacher sanjayin emerged from seclusion the states of absorption he had experienced had invigorated his senses
whoever has such a face must have qualities to match they approached him and asked
sir sanjayin what is your approach to the dharma
what instructions do you give to your students what is the result of living the holy life
what are its benefits sanjayin replied
young brahmins this is how i see it and this is my philosophy
the dharma is truth and nonviolence the peaceful ageless immortal and unwaning state is brahman
the two replied master what is the meaning of what you have said
as for truth renunciation is born of true thoughts
as for nonviolence all dharmas spring from the ground of nonviolence
the peaceful ageless immortal and unwaning state are other names by which nirvana may be known
that state is called brahma for if some were to achieve nirvana in this very life all would be well
but even if they did not achieve it they would still draw near to the world of brahma
even so brahmins will be reborn in the world of brahma
will alight into the world of brahma will have alighted into the world of brahma
gaining the fortune for the world of brahma is akin to entering nirvana
and how is the world of brahma
master allow us to go forth we pledge to live the holy life under your guidance
and with that the two became renunciants in sanjayins order
after the teacher sanjayin allowed upatisya and kolitas going forth
the news of their acceptance spread everywhere and sanjayin was lauded with many accolades and much praise
he thought
if i was a member of the sandilya clan before and am still a member now what has caused such abundant accolades and praise to come to me now
sanjayin thought it is not due to my own sway
rather it is the sway of these two young brahmins
thus when he accepted five hundred young brahmins for instruction in how to recite brahminic mantras he assigned two hundred and fifty to upatisya and two hundred and fifty to kolita
at one point after the teacher sanjayin had fallen ill upatisya asked kolita
kolita will you attend the master or will you seek out medicine for him
kolita thought
upatisya is intelligent i would have him attend the master while i go in search of medicine and said
please attend the master and i will seek medicine
upatisya began to attend the master and kolita went off in search of medicine
though upatisya ministered to the master with medicinal roots stalks leaves flowers and fruit the illness would not subside
though weak the master smiled prompting upatisya to ask
master given that great people like you do not smile for no reason
what causes you to smile what prompts it
upatisya replied sanjayin
allow me to explain great beings like me do not smile without cause or condition
i was thinking about the wife of king suvarnapati of suvarnadvipa when her husbands time had come she leapt onto his funeral pyre
i was thinking how the impulse to desire the very things desired and the pursuit of desire are what cause these sentient beings to suffer
when was this master at such and such a time a long time ago
in what month in such and such a month long ago
on what day on such and such a day long ago
sanjayin recorded this conversation on a board and set it down
master upatisya urged if the whole of what little renunciation we have is for ambrosia and the search for ambrosia
and if you master have found some small measure of that ambrosia
then please share it with us
son the whole of what little renunciation i have is for ambrosia and the search for ambrosia but neither have i discovered even a small measure of that ambrosia
allow me to explain on the fifteenth a day of fast i heard the gods who were passing through the heavens above say
at the foot of the snow mountains on the banks of the river bhagirathi not far from the sage kapilas hermitage a youth from the sakya clan has appeared
brahmins skilled in interpreting omens and signs made this prophecy
the youth installed in the palace will either become king of the world with his reign extending over the four directions
or he will become a king of dharma he will be endowed with the dharma or the seven precious emblems
the seven precious emblems he will possess are as follows
a precious wheel a precious elephant a precious horse
a precious jewel a precious woman a precious steward and a precious general
he will have a full one thousand sons heroic brave and of ideal build who will destroy enemy forces
but if he with perfect faith should cut his hair shave his beard don the saffron robes and go forth from home into homelessness
then he shall become a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha famed all over the world
where rule is impartial and in harmony with the dharma
under him the whole earth from sea to sea will be free from the threat of harm and violence and will be a realm without punishment or armed expulsion
you two should go forth into his teachings
having gone forth you should not proclaim your caste you should not proclaim your clan you should not proclaim your being a brahmin youth
once you have overcome conceit and pride you should live the holy life under his guidance and then you will receive a great ambrosia
then he said all accumulation ends in depletion
the lofty in the end will fall all meetings end in separation all life ends in death
on saying that he went the way of all temporal phenomena
after decorating the sides of his bier with blue yellow red and white cloth they carried his corpse to the charnel ground and cremated him
in time their grief subsided
n time a young brahmin named suvarnajata from suvarnadvipa arrived in rajagrha
when he entered their dwelling upatisya asked
young brahmin where have you come from
from suvarnadvipa he replied
young brahmin did you see anything at all amazing or remarkable in suvarnadvipa
i didnt see anything truly amazing or remarkable he replied
but i did see something somewhat amazing and remarkable so listen as you please
the wife of king suvarnapati of suvarnadvipa leapt onto his funeral pyre when her husbands time had come
when was this at such and such a time a long time ago
in what month in such and such a month long ago
on what day on such and such a day long ago
when upatisya looked at the conversation recorded on the board he saw that everything was exactly as sanjayin had said
at which point he said to kolita our master sanjayin concealed his learning from us
if he had found such rare ambrosia he did not share it with us
for if he himself saw forms in other lands with the divine eye and heard pleasant sounds with the divine ear
then his claim to have found no ambrosia is not true
kolita thought
upatisya is intelligent were he to find such ambrosia he may not tell me and a situation such as this might happen again
then he said upatisya join me in a pledge
whoever finds such ambrosia first he shall share it with the other
they made the pledge and set out on their journey going forth
when the blessed bodhisattva reached the age of twentynine he ceased to revel in desires for the sight of the elderly the sick and the dead had moved him deeply
he stole out in the middle of the night and fled into the forest
where he spent six years practicing austerities
but he came to see that those austerities would amount to nothing
he then breathed freely in and out and partook again of solid foods such as rice and porridge
he rubbed ghee and oil into his skin and took refreshing baths in warm water
when he came to the village of senani the village headmans daughters nanda and nandabala
gave him milk that had been churned sixteen times and mixed with honey to drink
he was lauded by the naga king kalika and he accepted a bundle of auspicious goldencolored kusa grass from a grassmonger
from there he went to what would be the site of his awakening
he arrived and settled crosslegged into an unshakable absorption on an unshakable bed of kusa grass
sitting straight and erect he settled his mind and said
i shall not uncross my legs until i have achieved the undefiled state
his intention pledged he said so long as i have not found an undefiled state i shall not uncross my legs
during the midnight hours through the power of his loving kindness the blessed one subdued mara and his retinue of million demonic spirits
and unsurpassed wisdom arose within him at brahmas request he went to varanasi
and turned the wheel of dharma revealing in three phases a teaching with twelve aspects
during that time he converted the group of five the five friends and fifty highborn village brahmin youths
who then went forth and received full ordination
while passing through the karpasi forest he convinced a noble band of sixty youths of the truths
while passing through the village of senani
he convinced the village headmans daughters nanda and nandabala of the truths
while passing through uruvilva
he inspired a group of one thousand dreadlocked ascetics to go forth and ordained them
while passing by the gayasirsa stupa he instructed those one thousand monks by displaying three miracles
thereby freeing them from the wilds of samsara and establishing them in the utterly final state of perfection and the unsurpassably blissful state of nirvana
while passing through the yasti forest
he brought the king of magadha bimbisara of the guilds to the truths along with gods and many hundreds of thousands of magadhan brahmins and householders
while passing through rajagrha he accepted the offering of a bamboo grove
it was then that the blessed buddha took up residence at the kalandakanivasa in rajagrhas bamboo grove
on their journeys and travels upatisya and kolita also arrived in rajagrha
they saw that rajagrha was utterly still and thought
one of only two things could have brought utter quiet to this town
either fear of neighboring armies or the presence of several ascetics and brahmins famed for their merit and majesty
as they began to examine the stars they acknowledged
as neighboring armies present no imminent danger tomorrow we shall know more
the two were in the habit of daubing three lines of ash across their foreheads and going out on their daily rounds
when they did so many hundreds of thousands of creatures would always follow after them
the next day they daubed three lines of ash across their foreheads and went out on their daily rounds
however on that day not a single being followed after them
on returning they considered the matter
they saw that not a single being had followed after them and wondered
in the past when we have gone out on rounds many hundreds of thousands of creatures would follow after us
why then has not a single being followed after us today
there is nothing even in the slightest the blessed buddhas do not know
do not see are not aware of or do not notice
thus the blessed buddha subsists alive and well endowed with great compassion
engaged in actions to help the world
is its sole protector its lone champion one of a kind
does not speak duplicitously is sustained by calm abiding and insight illuminates the three types of knowledge
is welltrained in the three trainings is skilled in the three approaches to discipline
has crossed the four rivers is wellgrounded in his use of the four foundations of miraculous conduct
and is one who long ago perfected the four means of attraction
who teaches the four noble truths who being fearless in four ways is never frightened who has abandoned the five branches
has transcended the five rebirths teaches the five aggregates to be selfless
is in possession of the six branches and has perfected the six perfections
who always abides by the six spheres who binds the six sense gates
who accustoms himself to the six dharmas that elicit perfect joy
who is rich with the flower of awakenings seven branches who displays the seven treasures of a noble being
who is unstained by the eight mundane concerns who knows the nine things that inspire aggression
who teaches the eight branches of the path who is skilled in the nine stages of meditative absorption
who possesses the strength of the ten strengths whose good name has spread in the ten directions
and who surpasses those who rule over the thousandfold universe
as it is in the nature of such beings to watch over the world with their buddha eye during the three times of the day and night
they know and see who has fallen who has flourished who hurts
who wants who is unhappy who hurts
who wants who is unhappy who is headed for a miserable rebirth
who will fall into a miserable rebirth who will decide to rise from his path towards a miserable rebirth and land in a highstatus rebirth
liberation or the fruition
who will reach out his hand to those sinking in the mud of desire
who lacks the riches of a noble beings treasures who will come to the magnificent wealth of a noble beings treasures
whose buddhahood with its attendant fruits will ornament the world
whose latent roots of virtue will bud
whose budding roots of virtue will blossom
and who having blossomed will be freed
it has been said the home of noxious water beasts may in time evaporate
but the love of buddhas for their disciples shall not
thus the blessed one watches over the world with his buddha eye
with this eye the blessed one saw that the minds of the wanderers upatisya and kolita had been ripened through their service to past buddhas
so its love for those who fall to the miserable realms and samsara is like the cows love for its fallen calf
an omniscient minds compassion never wanes in its quest for the young calves it nurses
tathagatas too hold dear and protect their disciples
as a mother holds dear and protects her only child
and the stores of virtue they had amassed
and the stores of virtue they had amassed
and thus he understood that the two wanderers were like fruit ripe for the plucking the time to train them had come
the blessed one thought
will these two be captivated by the teacher or by his disciples
and saw they would be captivated by disciples
thinking that he saw they would be drawn by conduct
he thought what will be their way into the renunciant order will they be drawn by miracles or by conduct
the blessed one summoned the venerable asvajit whose conduct he saw would captivate them
for conduct like his captivated gods and men
then the blessed one instructed the venerable asvajit
asvajit consider the wanderers upatisya and kolita
asvajits silence indicated his assent to the blessed ones instruction
as asvajit was fully committed to acting on the blessed ones instruction he praised and welcomed the blessed ones instruction
bowing his head at the blessed ones feet he said i go with the blessed ones guidance
early the next morning after the night had passed the venerable asvajit put on his lower robe picked up his begging bowl and dharma robes and went to beg alms in rajagrha
as he walked he gazed just ahead he gazed to his left and right
with his arms drawn in and his legs extended dignified by his ceremonial robe dharma robes and begging bowl
meanwhile the wanderer upatisya was out and about in rajagrha on some errand when he saw from afar the venerable asvajit who had come to beg alms in rajagrha
upatisya saw him walking gazing just ahead gazing to his left and right
his arms drawn in and his legs extended dignified by his robe shawl and begging bowl
on seeing him he thought
so this is what the renunciants who come to live here in rajagrha are like
never in my life have i seen anyone carry himself like this renunciant
i must approach him and ask monk who is your teacher
knowing the monk was likely to pass by one of the main crossroads upatisya went there to wait
when the venerable asvajit reached the spot where upatisya was
upatisya asked this of asvajit
monk who is your teacher why have you gone forth whose dharma do you favor
gautama the venerable monk and prince of the sakyas left the sakya clan shaved his head and beard
donned the saffron robes and with perfect faith went forth from home into homelessness
in his unsurpassed perfect awakening he has become a perfect buddha
my teacher is the blessed one
it is because of him that i have gone forth it is his dharma that i favor
monk then you must share one of his teachings
venerable i am but young and a new renunciant so it would not be easy for me to fully and perfectly explain the teachings of the blessed one who is a tathagata an arhat a perfect buddha
thus i will share with you their import
monk the import is what i need what good is a lengthy explanation
please teach me the import whatever its length
the venerable asvajit spoke this verse
those phenomena that arise from causes the tathagata himself has taught that they have a cause and also a cessation the great sramana is the one who thus proclaims
those phenomena that arise from causes the tathagata himself has taught that they have a cause and also a cessation
the great sramana is the one who thus proclaims
once he had explained this aspect of the dharma upatisya came to see phenomena through the unclouded and pristine eyes of dharma
upatisya saw the dharma heard the dharma
knew the dharma plumbed the depths of the dharma overcame his skepticism
transcended doubt could not be swayed by others and was not reliant on others
with his newfound fearless confidence in the dharma taught by the teacher he stood up from his seat
ulled his shawl from one shoulder bowed to the venerable asvajit with his palms pressed together and spoke in verse
this is the dharma of saviors for millions upon billions of eons
i have neither seen it nor heard it may i come to realize this immortal and peaceful state
venerable where is the blessed one now
venerable at the kalandakanivapa in the bamboo grove outside rajagrha
upatisya then praised and welcomed what asvajit had said
after prostrating at asvajits feet he circumambulated him three times and went to see kolita
from a long way off kolita saw upatisya approaching
on meeting him he said to upatisya
venerable your faculties are clear and your complexion lustrous
if your skin is so radiant does that mean you have found ambrosia
i have found someone worth venerating
share this venerable ones teaching upatisya then spoke in verse
the great sramana is the one who thus proclaims
venerable please repeat it one more time venerable say it again
those phenomena that arise from causes the tathagata himself has taught that they have a cause and also a cessation
once upatisya had explained this aspect of the dharma
kolita too came to see phenomena through the unclouded and pristine eyes of dharma
kolita saw the dharma heard the dharma knew the dharma plumbed the depths of the dharma
overcame his skepticism transcended doubt
could not be swayed by others and could not be led astray by others
having gained a fearless confidence in the dharma taught by the teacher
he stood up from his seat pulled his shawl from one shoulder bowed to upatisya with his palms pressed together
nd spoke in verse
this is the dharma of saviors for millions upon billions of eons
i have neither seen it nor heard it may i come to realize this immortal and peaceful state
venerable where is the blessed one now
at the kalandakanivapa in the bamboo grove outside rajagrha
come we must live the holy life under the guidance of the blessed one
but venerable we must first see our followers
for it is only proper that knowledgeable and prominent people like us visit our followers
so the wanderers upatisya and kolita went to the young brahmins and said
young brahmins listen
what will you do if we two go to live the holy life under the guidance of the blessed one
masters the little we seek we seek because of you
so if you two masters go to live the holy life under the guidance of the blessed one and go forth we too will go forth
young brahmins then know that the time has come
upatisya and kolita and their students apiece then went to the kalandakanivapa in the bamboo grove
at the time the venerable asvajit was seated taking shelter from the sun at the foot of a tree
the wanderers upatisya and kolita saw the venerable asvajit from a long way off
on seeing him upatisya asked kolita
kolita do we first pay our respects to the blessed one or to the one from whom we have heard of his dharma
to the one from whom we have heard of his dharma
the two of them went to the venerable asvajit reaching him they prostrated at his feet before taking a seat off to one side
like a pure brahmin does to fire bow with respect to the one whether he be young or old who tells you of the dharma
at that point a brahmin who loved fire paid it homage and respect
he then spoke a verse of the blessed ones
when upatisya and kolita had prostrated at the feet of asvajit they left and went to where the blessed one was
at the time the blessed one was seated teaching dharma to a crowd of many hundreds of monk followers
the blessed one saw upatisya and kolita from a long way off
when he saw them he said to the monks
monks embrace your friends bring them to the head of the assembly let them come before you
do you see upatisya and kolita or do you see venerable ones
these two will become my disciples my foremost and noblest pair
for one shall become the greatest of miracle workers and the other shall become the wisest of the wise
a monk then spoke a verse
to what the teacher knows there is no end his mind the perfection of human capacity
the blessed one has reached samsaras end
so before our friends upatisya and kolita arrived in the bamboo grove he foresaw their coming and said with certainty among this gathering
one will be the greatest of miracle workers the other will be the wisest of the wise
these two will become the foremost among all my disciples
upatisya and kolita then approached the blessed one
prostrated at his feet and made the following request
if we are permitted reverend we would obtain the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
we would live the holy life in the blessed ones presence
with but a weeks worth of hair and beard
only after the blessed one had given his consent did their hair fall out and they were clothed in robes
the blessed one said to them come join me thereby allowing their going forth
he enjoined them with the words monks come join me and live the holy life
again it is said hair tonsured and body clad in robes from the tathagatas call to come forth that moment their senses were perfectly stilled
having completed their approach to monkhood they stood with the deportment of monks who had been ordained for one hundred years
with but a weeks worth of hair and beard alms bowl and water pitcher in their hands
for then will your body be swathed in the buddhas mind
and entered rajagrha to beg for alms
early the next morning a great many monks put on their lower robes took up their begging bowls and dharma robes
the buddha has come to rajagrha magadhas premier city
vilifying the monks they spoke in verse
and joined the buddhas renunciant order they quickly became disappointed and visibly upset
and led away all sanjayins students only when there was naught else to lead away
the monks were crestfallen upset and lost their fearlessness
washed their feet and went hurting and upset to see the blessed one
having gone to collect alms in rajagrha the great many monks ate what they had been given and
as alms are not sought after noon packed their begging bowls and dharma robes
as they arrived the great many monks prostrated at the blessed ones feet
sat off to one side and told the blessed one
reverend early this morning a great many of us monks put on our robes
picked up our begging bowls and dharma robes and went to rajagrha to collect alms
there when the people of rajagrha saw that members of sanjayins tirthika community had renounced it
vilifying us they spoke in verse
vilifying us they spoke in verse
the buddha has come to rajagrha magadhas premier city and and led away all sanjayins students only when there was naught else to lead away
with this we became crestfallen upset and lost our fearlessness
monks instructed the blessed one say this to the people of rajagrha who say such things
here the mighty sugatas lead with the sublime dharma
what wise man could reject such noble leadership
that will dispel all the vanity and selfassurance of the people of rajagrha who speak like that
early the next morning a great many monks put on their robes took up their begging bowls and dharma robes
and entered rajagrha to beg for alms
when the people of rajagrha saw that members of sanjayins tirthika community had renounced it and joined the buddhas renunciant order they soon become disappointed and visibly upset
vilifying the monks they again spoke the same verse
one monk then replied
here the mighty sugatas lead with the sublime dharma
what wise man could reject such noble leadership
with that statement he dispelled all the vanity and selfassurance of the people of rajagrha who spoke like that
some time later the brahmin matharas time came as did his wifes
the brahmin tisyas time came as did sarikas
tisyas son kosthila returned to the village of nalada from the south where he had taken up with the lokayata ascetics
the village gatekeeper recognized him and asked
sir are you kosthila people know me thus
what has become of the brahmin mathara his time came
what has become of his wife her time came
what has become of the brahmin tisya his time came too
what has become of sarika her time came too
what has become of sariputra shortly after a teacher named sanjayin appeared in rajagrha he went forth and joined his renunciant order
lately it has become common for brahmins to go forth
kosthila then made his way to rajagrha and when he arrived there he asked
what has become of the teacher sanjayin his time came
what has become of his tirthika community
they have all gone forth and joined the renunciant order around the ascetic gautama
it would have been good had the ascetic gautama who was prophesied to become king of the world become royal priest
as he sat there off to one side dirghanakha said to the blessed one
o gautama no self endures
son of a selfimmolator even that view you hold which views all forms of self as unable to endure does not itself endure
agreed o gautama replied dirghanakha even that view which views all forms of self as unable to endure does not itself endure
if you see it like that that view too will be abandoned discarded and cease to be
son of a selfimmolator then know this
other views too will not be entertained embraced or arise
o gautama i know this
the blessed one replied at length son of a selfimmolator you are like and akin to most people
kosthila who had taken the name dirghanakha when he became a wanderer went to see the blessed one
when he arrived he and the blessed one were clearly overjoyed to see one another and exchanged warm words of goodwill before dirghanakha sat off to one side
for most people also view things thus and say such things and in that you are just like them
son of a selfimmolator in this world those ascetics and brahmins who discard this view
and those ascetics and brahmins who do not embrace other views are said to be the fewest of the few
son of a selfimmolator there are three positions regarding the view what are those three positions
son of a selfimmolator regarding this point some hold the view and argue that all selves endure
others hold the view and argue that no self endures
while still others hold the view and argue that some selves endure and other selves do not endure
son of a selfimmolator in holding that all selves endure attachment will arise
and attachment will not disappear aversion will arise and aversion will not disappear
confusion will arise and confusion will not disappear
accumulation will occur and accumulation will not disappear
fetters will occur and fetters will not disappear
and defilement will arise and purification will not occur
with this view that holds that all selves endure eager anticipation pursuit and excessive attachment will arise
and purification will occur and defilement will disappear
one will be free of fetters and fetters will not occur
accumulation will disappear and accumulation will not occur
confusion will disappear and confusion will not arise
aversion will disappear and aversion will not arise
son of a selfimmolator in holding that no self endures
attachment will disappear and attachment will not arise
with this view that holds that no self endures there will be no eager anticipation
no pursuit and excessive attachment will disappear
son of a selfimmolator regarding the view that some selves endure and other selves do not endure
in holding that some selves do endure attachment will arise and attachment will not disappear
aversion will arise and aversion will not disappear
confusion will arise and confusion will not disappear
accumulation will occur and accumulation will not disappear
fetters will occur and fetters will not disappear
and defilement will arise and purification will not occur
with this view that holds that some selves endure eager anticipation
pursuit and excessive attachment will arise
at the same time in holding that some selves do not endure attachment will disappear and attachment will not arise
aversion will disappear and aversion will not arise
confusion will disappear and confusion will not arise
accumulation will disappear and accumulation will not occur
one will be free of fetters and fetters will not occur
and purification will occur and defilement will disappear
with this view that holds that some selves do not endure there will be no eager anticipation
informed noble disciples scrutinize the first position in this way
if one holds the view and argues that all selves endure then the view and argument that no self endures
and the view and argument that some selves endure while other selves do not endure would counter and undermine the self
if it counters it would undermine and if it undermines it would debunk the self
in correctly seeing the countering the undermining and the debunking thus done
that view too would be abandoned and other views would not be embraced
thus that view of self too would be abandoned discarded and cease to be
while other views too would not be entertained embraced or arise
informed noble disciples scrutinize the second position in this way
if one holds the view and argues that no self endures then the view and argument that all selves endure
informed noble disciples scrutinize the third position in this way
the view and argument that all selves endure and the view and argument that no selves endure would counter and undermine the self
if one holds the view and argues that some selves endure while other selves do not endure
while other views too would not be entertained embraced or arise
son of a selfimmolator as this body is composed of gross form and arises from the four great elements
noble disciples observe and dwell on its repeated arising and destruction
if noble disciples observe and dwell on its repeated arising and destruction
whatever aspirations attachment craving obsessions
preoccupations or excessive attachment may arise towards the body will be confronted and will not remain
son of a selfimmolator there are three feelings what are these three
pleasure pain and that which is neither pleasant nor painful
son of a selfimmolator when noble disciples experience feelings of pleasure
then feelings of pain and feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful come to a halt
at that time noble disciples experience only feelings of pleasure
yet feelings of pleasure too are subject to impermanence suffering and cessation
when noble disciples experience feelings of pain
then feelings of pleasure and feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful come to a halt
at that time noble disciples experience only feelings of pain
yet feelings of pain too are subject to impermanence suffering and cessation
when noble disciples experience feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful then feelings of pleasure and pain come to a halt
at that time noble disciples experience only feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful
yet feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful too are subject to impermanence suffering and cessation
thus they think what is the basis for these feelings
what are their origins what types of things are compatible with them
what has produced their arising
on reflection the basis for these feelings is contact
their origins lie in contact they are compatible with contact what has produced them is contact
thus contact of different types occurs prompting feelings of different types to arise
contact of different types cease prompting feelings of different types to cease
to calm to cool off to fade away
thus when they experience feelings that are pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful
they thoroughly and precisely understand their origins their fading their flavor their shortcomings and their perfect renunciation
and viewing and resting in its utter abandonment they are not taken in even in the slightest by the world
viewing it free of desirous attachment viewing its cessation
when they view and rest in the impermanence of any feeling that arises while viewing its dwindling viewing its disintegration
they view it free of desirous attachment they view its cessation and view and rest in its utter abandonment
they view its dwindling they view its disintegration
they view and rest in the impermanence of any feeling that arises
when they thoroughly and precisely understand their origins their fading their flavor their shortcomings and their perfect renunciation
if they are not taken in there will be no torment
if there is no torment they will understand that their births have come to an end
that they have lived the holy life that they have done what needed doing
and that they will know no lives after this one
and that they will know no lives after this one thus they themselves will altogether transcend misery
when they experience the bodys most basic feelings
they thoroughly and precisely understand them with the thought i am experiencing the bodys most basic feelings
when they experience the lifeforces most basic feeling
they thoroughly and precisely understand it with the thought i am experiencing the lifeforces most basic feeling
since the lifeforce comes to an end after the body has perished
all of that lifes feelings every last one of them come to a halt
every last one of them fades away every last one of them dwindles away
and every last one of them comes to an end
thus they think when i experience feelings of pleasure if the body should perish that will be the end of suffering
when i experience feelings of pain and feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful
if the body should perish that will be the end of suffering
thus when they experience the feeling of pleasure it is unaccompanied it is not accompanied by experiences
when they experience the feeling of pain or a feeling that is neither pleasant nor painful it is unaccompanied it is not accompanied by experiences
what does not accompany their death it is not accompanied by desire aversion or confusion
it is not accompanied by birth aging illness death mourning cries of misery
pain unease or disturbance
it is not i argue accompanied by suffering
during this talk the venerable sariputra who had been ordained two weeks earlier
sat fanning the blessed one
sariputra then had this thought
the blessed one has praised the abandonment of such phenomena along with the freedom from the cessation of and the utter abandonment of desire
i too should observe and abide by the abandonment of such phenomena
and should observe freedom from desire
sariputra then observed and abided by the abandonment of such phenomena
i too should observe and abide by the abandonment of such phenomena and should observe freedom from desire
i too should observe and abide by the abandonment of such phenomena and its cessation i too should observe and abide by its utter abandonment
he proceeded to observe freedom from desire observe its cessation and observe and abide by its utter abandonment
for then will your body be swathed in the buddhas mind
though your head be tonsured and your body clad in robes it is more important that your senses be stilled
again it is said once called by the tathagata to come forth
he stood with the deportment of a monk who had been ordained for one hundred years
heard the dharma knew the dharma plumbed the depths of the dharma
overcame his skepticism transcended doubt
could not be swayed by others and could not be led astray by others
with his newfound fearless confidence in the dharma taught by the teacher he stood up from his seat
pulled his shawl from one shoulder bowed to the blessed one with his palms pressed together
and made the following request to the blessed one
if it is permitted reverend i would obtain the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
i would live the holy life in the blessed ones presence
dirghanakha saw the dharma
the wanderer dirghanakha too came to see phenomena through the unclouded and pristine eyes of dharma
and observe and abide by its utter abandonment his mind in the absence of grasping was freed from defilements
as he observed and abided by the abandonment of such phenomena and proceeded to observe freedom from desire observe its cessation
only after the blessed one had given his consent did his hair fall out and was he clothed in robes
with but a weeks worth of hair and beard alms bowl and water pitcher in hand having completed his approach to monkhood
the blessed one said to him come join me thereby allowing his going forth
and enjoined him with the words monk come join me and live the holy life
with this going forth dirghanakha went to live alone in solitude diligent and persevering devoted to his resolve
while living alone in solitude diligent and persevering devoted to his resolve
he perceived that he had in that very life actualized the unsurpassed aim of the holy life for which the sons of noble families
a section index
thus the venerable one achieved the allknowing state of an arhat whose mind had been utterly freed
i have done what needed doing i will know no lives after this one
with his achievement he understood my births have come to an end i have lived the holy life
with perfect faith cut their hair shave their beards don the saffron robes and go forth from home into homelessness
all selves do not endure you who view things thus
you are just like them worldly persons ascetics and brahmins
and their three positions on the view informed noble disciples
body feelings and the cessation of the basis for feelings understanding their origin and the like
transcending misery the most basic of body and lifeforce life ends unaccompanied
with the perishing of the body and the end of suffering and lastly sariputra
the blessed one said to the monks
monks among my monk disciples who have gained the knowledge of perfect discernment
the monk kosthila is supreme
in doubt the monks went to him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha and asked
reverend what is it that the venerable sariputra has done
that the ripened fruit of that action has made his intellect sharper finer and more incisive
monks replied the blessed one
sariputra himself discovered the store of action mastered conditions
tended to them as one does an irrigation channel and emerged without indecision
as he himself acted and accumulated thus no one else experiences the results of actions and accumulations as sariputra has done
monks actions and accumulations do not ripen upon the outer elements
they do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
the virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated
come to fruition upon the aggregates elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons when the time and the conditions are right they alight upon embodied beings
monks long ago a brahmin who lived in a remote mountain range took a wife of equal caste and together they sported made love and indulged all their desires
from their sporting lovemaking and the indulging all of their desires there came a boy whom they named surpi
again they sported made love and indulged all their desires producing a girl whom they named suksma
after a while their brahmin fathers time came as did his wifes
the young brahmin surpi because he loved solitude took his sister to live in a remote forest
at a certain point his sister suksma grew into a woman and at the time beset by disturbing emotions said
brother i cannot be sustained by the medicinal plants in this forest let us go to the outskirts of town
so surpi took his sister to the outskirts of town and as they approached a house to beg alms
a brahmin sitting in his home heard the voice of a man speaking to a woman
on hearing this the brahmin came out and asked
what is a sage doing traveling with a wife
this is not my wife this is my younger sister
would you give us a little something to eat
i will not and if i refuse would you give me your sister
that would be a sin and i reject such ignoble principles
suksma said brother the medicinal plants in this forest do not sustain me so it was i who suggested we go to the edge of town
why did i suggest it incapacitated as i am by emotions i trusted you would know what to do
why did i suggest it incapacitated as i am by emotions i trusted you would know what to do
i will give a large dowry and take her as my bride said the brahmin
brother let us leave said suksma and together they stepped away
surpi said it is because i do not pursue desires that i have gone to remote places
then brother should you attain even the slightest store of qualities you must come share them with me
surpi went off into the wilds and without a teacher or a guide
gave rise to the thirtyseven qualities conducive to awakening and actualized his own awakening
he then thought
i promised to share any such attainment with my sister so i must do so
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
so out of the great love and compassion surpi felt like a swan spreading its wings
he flew up into the sky above and began to miraculously invoke flashes and bursts of light clouds and lightning
now because ordinary beings are swift to pay heed to miracles
suksma dropped like a felled tree at the pratyekabuddhas feet and said
noble one have you found such a store of qualities i have
noble one accept these alms
i seek merit so please stay here and let me provide you all the provisions you need
sister first ask the master of the house she went to the brahmin the master of the house and said
son of a lord my brother has gone forth accomplished his vow and become a great being
please allow him to stay and i will offer him all the provisions he needs
her husband replied if i give to laymen without being asked
why would i not give to a renunciant who has lived up to his vows and become a saint
go do as you please and offer him all the provisions he needs
after three months during which she offered the pratyekabuddha all the provisions he needed
she offered him a piece of cotton cloth large enough to be worn as a robe a needle a razor and thread
he accepted the cotton cloth needle razor and thread and began to cut the cloth in front of her
as he sharpened the razors blade
suksma prostrated at his feet and said this prayer
just as this razors blade becomes sharper and sharper
may these roots of virtue sharpen my intellect
the pratyekabuddha began to poke holes with the needle and as the needle made finer and finer holes
just as this needle pokes finer and finer holes
may these roots of virtue refine my intellect
the pratyekabuddha began to sew with the thread and as the thread passed through the cloth unhindered
may these roots of virtue help me develop an incisive intellect
just as this thread passes unhindered through cloth
monks at that time the monk sariputra was the brahmins daughter suksma
that action of making offerings and prayers to the pratyekabuddha ripened so that now his intellect is sharp fine and incisive
monks the ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negative
but the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive
and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixed
monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions
and seek wholly positive actions monks this is how you should train
still in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
reverend what has the venerable sariputra done that the ripened fruit of his action has led to his birth into a family that is neither extremely rich nor extremely poor
but into a family of moderate means with many renunciants
the blessed one replied
monks sariputra himself discovered the store of action mastered conditions
and so no one else experiences sariputras actions and accumulations for themselves
tended to them as one does an irrigation channel and emerged without indecision he himself acted and accumulated this store
monks actions and accumulations do not ripen upon the external elements
they do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated come to ripen upon the aggregates
elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons
when the time and the conditions are right they alight upon embodied beings
monks long ago a king who lived in a remote mountain range took a wife of equal caste
and together they sported made love and indulged all of their desires
from their sporting lovemaking and the indulging all of their desires
there came a boy whom they nurtured and raised until he grew into a man
seeing that his father ruled in ways compatible with the principles of justice the boy thought
when my father passes i will become king
if i exercise my royal authority in ways compatible with the principles of justice in a later life i will go to hell
he went to the king and said
father grant me leave i wish to go forth in the wellproclaimed dharma and vinaya
the king replied
son the royal authority for which you have made offerings to the gods performed fire puja and suffered through austerities is within reach
having been born into a caste borne about by elephants why would you renounce itand with that his father refused to let him go forth
some time later the boy set out riding astride the neck of an elephant
when he saw a poor man on his begging rounds holding a staff and a broken beggars bowl
the prince went to him and said
householder because i was born into a wealthy family i could not get consent to go forth
you are poor so why have you not joined such an order
prince he replied how could i go forth if i dont have a begging bowl or a dharma robe
good man come said the prince i will give you a begging bowl and a dharma robe
the prince then took him to the sanctuary of a sage endowed with the five types of heightened awareness
the prince got down from his perch atop the elephants neck and said calmly
sir this noble son wishes to go forth
allow him to do so and i shall provide his begging bowl and dharma robe
so the sage allowed the beggar to go forth
the prince then washed a begging bowl and had a dharma robe cut sewn and dyed
he handed them over to the former beggar and said
noble one should you attain even the slightest store of qualities you must tell me
he promised the prince he would do so and went off into the wilds
without a teacher or a guide he gave rise to the thirtyseven qualities conducive to awakening and actualized his own awakening
he then thought
this small store of qualities i have attained i have attained with the help of the prince
i promised to share any such attainment with him so i must do so
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
so out of the great love and compassion he felt like a swan spreading its wings he flew up into the sky above
and miraculously invoked flashes and bursts of light clouds and lightning
now because ordinary beings are swift to pay heed to miracles
the prince dropped like a felled tree at the pratyekabuddhas feet and said
noble one have you found such a store of qualities
i havethe prince thought if the small store of qualities this noble being has attained
he has attained with my help then this noble beings failure to get consent to go forth was due to his birth into a lowly family like his
my own failure to get consent to go forth was due to my birth into a high family such as mine
with that thought he prostrated at the pratyekabuddhas feet and made this prayer
by these roots of virtue may i be born not in a wealthy house nor in one that is poor let it be rather in a house of moderate means and always among many renunciants
monks the monk sariputra was at that time the prince
that action of making offerings and prayers to the pratyekabuddha ripened
so that now he was not born into too rich a family nor into too poor a family
but rather into a family of moderate means in which there were many renunciants
monks thus the ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negative while the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive
and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixed
monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions and seek wholly positive actions
monks this is how you should train
monks this is how you should train
still in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
the blessed one replied it is the prayers he made
reverend what has the venerable sariputra done that the ripened fruit of his action has led him to be singled out by the blessed one as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
one who knew the world an unsurpassed guide who tamed beings a teacher to gods and men
a teacher a tathagata an arhat a perfectly awakened buddha a knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata
what did he pray for
monks long ago during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years
the blessed buddha kasyapa appeared in the world
who lived and dwelt in the rsipatana deer park near varanasi
later as he was dying he made this prayer
he lived the holy life for the rest of his days but he did not attain any store of qualities
a monk he who would later become sariputra went forth into kasyapas teachings
and was singled out by the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
although i have spent my entire life living the holy life under kasyapa an arhat a blessed tathagata a perfectly awakened buddha and unsurpassed object of veneration
i have not attained any store of qualities
young brahmin in the future when the lifespan of beings is one hundred years
arhat and blessed tathagata and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa has prophesied to the young brahmin uttara saying
may the roots of virtue accumulated through living the holy life for my entire lifetime
you will become the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha
the knowledgeable and venerable one
the sugata the one who knows the world the unsurpassed guide who tames beings
the teacher to gods and men known as the blessed buddha sakyamuni
nd that i may go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
and just as i this master was singled out by the tathagata the arhat and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa
king of the sakyas
actions never waste away
the virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated come to ripen upon the aggregates
elements and seats of the senses of the one who performed them
monks actions and accumulations do not ripen upon the external elements
the element of water the element of fire nor upon the element of wind
monks maudgalyayana himself discovered the store of action mastered conditions
tended to them as one does an irrigation channel and emerged without indecision
he himself acted and accumulated thus so no one else experiences maudgalyayanas actions and accumulations for themselves
the blessed one replied
reverend what has the venerable the great maudgalyayana done
that the ripened fruit of his action has led to him being the most powerful and the greatest miracle worker
as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
because of that prayer sariputra has now been singled out by the tathagata
as the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confident
may i too be singled out by the blessed sage of the sakyas lion of the sakyas
actions never waste away not even after one hundred eons
when the time and the conditionsare right they alight upon embodied beings
monks long ago in a sanctuary not very far from the city of varanasi there lived a sage who personified loving kindness
endowed with compassion he was kind to all sentient beings
one day a poor man arrived at the sanctuary carrying a bundle of wood
the sage saw him put down his bundle of wood before sitting down to rest
feeling compassion for him he thought he has been born a human but because of faulty actions done in the past this afflicted man must struggle very hard to make a living
i shall allow his going forththe sage called out son who are you
noble one i am a poor man who makes his living from wood
well then why do you not go forth
noble one if i am a poor man who must work very hard to forge a living by selling wood
who would allow me to go forth
because the sage was the very personification of loving kindness he felt tremendous compassion for the man and asked
son do you wish to go forth
noble one i seek to go forth so in your love i ask that you allow me
the sage allowed him to go forth then washed a begging bowl and dyed a dharma robe and gave them to him saying
good man should you attain even the slightest store of qualities you must tell me
the man promised to do so and he went off into the wilds
without a teacher or a guide he gave rise to the thirtyseven qualities conducive to awakening
and actualized his own awakening
then he thought i promised to share any such attainment with that sage so i must do so
great persons teach the dharma through their actions and not their words
so out of the great love and compassion he felt like a swan spreading its wings
he flew up into the sky above and miraculously invoked flashes and bursts of light clouds and lightning
as ordinary beings are swift to pay heed to miracles
the sage dropped like a felled tree at the pratyekabuddhas feet and said
noble one have you found such a store of qualities
i havethe sage thought
the small store of qualities this noble being has attained he has attained with my help
and with that he prostrated at the pratyekabuddhas feet and made this prayer
just as this noble being is powerful and a great miracle worker
through these roots of virtue may i too become powerful and a great miracle worker
reverend what is it that the venerable the great maudgalyayana has done
that the ripened fruit of his action has led the blessed one to declare him as the greatest and most powerful miracle worker
in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the blessed buddha
monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions and seek wholly positive actions
monks this is how you should train
while the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive and the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixed
the blessed one replied it is the prayers he made what did he pray for
monks long ago during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand years

i have spent my entire life living the holy life under kasyapa the blessed tathagata the arhat and perfectly awakened buddha and unsurpassed object of veneration
but i have not attained any store of qualities
may the roots of virtue accumulated through living the holy life for my entire lifetime
the knowledgeable and venerable one the sugata the one who knows the world
you will become the tathagata the arhat the perfectly awakened buddha
young brahmin in the future when the lifespan of beings is one hundred years
and that i may go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
about whom the blessed tathagata and perfectly awakened buddha kasyapa has prophesied to the young brahmin uttara saying

reverend what is it that the venerable kosthila has done
